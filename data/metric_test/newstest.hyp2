Munich 1856 : four maps that change your view of the city
An insane institution , where young people are to meet today .
A pit chapel , where work is now being done on the S-Bahn tunnel .
Small gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers .
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories .
It is annoying when maps are not up to date .
Everybody knows that , because the Auto Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas , an offer of the Bavarian Geoportals of the State Government , are anything but current - but for this very reason very instructive .
Especially if you compare them with current online maps .
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the Munich Mercury distribution area have changed since the 19th century .
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not immediately recognizable as such .
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and towns , so-called original position sheets .
According to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung ( Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung ) , these were created between 1810 and 1864 and stem from Bavaria 's first survey .
Your client : Napoleon .
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic photograph of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , it was the current neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map .
Elector Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the " topographic Bureau " - and with it the Bavarian surveying administration .
The original manuscript for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek , just like any other .
The comparison of the past and present is most impressive on the example of the state capital .
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
An example of this is Untersendling , which still appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was drawn up , i.e. in 1877 .
Today , Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse , which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705 .
Where the Westpark is today , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zooming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-written numbered tracts from the so-called " Uraufnahme , " from which the property tax was derived .
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the " land in sun " plant .
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling .
The Theresienwiese , the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .
In the original fact sheet , in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , one reads not only the street name " am Gasteig " or " auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " irren Anstalt . "
Yes , people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstrasse .
It was there that the Munich-based Kreis-Irrenanstalt " auf der Auer Lüften " was founded in 1858 / 59 .
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
" He was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the chains of so-called lunatics .
In addition , he prohibited the staff from using force against the inmates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Haidhausen museum , who worked with the institution for an exhibition .
At first there was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 .
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905 .
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatric clinics in Germany , has been located there .
On the site of the former Auer institution , young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich .
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV München Ost , to the east residential buildings from the 1980s .
In 2015 , the children 's home " Casa Don Bosco " was built , based on the original building of the Irrenanstalt , which was destroyed during bombing raids during the Second World War .
The Marienplatz was listed as " main Square " around 1856 , the Kaufingerstrasse was called " Kaufinger Gasse . "
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
A large one has remained to this day - at the Marienhof .
The English Institute , small business houses and a mining chapel from the Middle Ages were once located at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work is taking place these days and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second commuter railway line is taking place on 5 April 2017 .
With the slider , the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up .
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Farmers has issued a warning for people of color who travel to Missouri because of the state 's discriminatory policies and racist attacks .
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is scheduled to take effect until August 28 , 2017 , urges African-American travelers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state , as a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently occurred and are recorded throughout the state , " the group 's statement said .
A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits , as well as the state 's law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , the NAACP said .
" They have civil rights violations that happen to people .
They are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten up or killed , " the president of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , told the Kansas City Star .
" We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven 't heard before . "
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the U.S.
The group cited incidents such as racial offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while traveling through the state and being taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime .
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General 's Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites .
" The recommendation is that people be aware and let their families , friends and co-workers know what could happen in Missouri , " chapel said .
" People have to be prepared , whether they bring a deposit or let relatives know that they are going through the state . "
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI 's hate crimes reporting program , which ranks the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations .
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .
Earlier , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations , which the ACLU said will help further racial profiling .
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
Fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidefence project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
The members of the CDU , Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac , got a picture on the spot .
At the Schwendemann family 's right-hand grave yard , representatives of the Fisherman 's Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies .
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals , and hosts holiday guests in five apartments .
For him , " Schwarzwaldmilch " is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .
Only regional dishes are available on the table of holiday guests .
Since he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he described the Weidezaunprojekt project as " fundamentally important . "
I cannot make a profit on such steep areas .
The grassland area provides a lot of work , a lot of it has to be done with the motorsense .
" We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography , " stressed Schwendemann .
In 2003 , he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a biofarm .
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " the municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is pleased with the leadership support . "
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of between EUR 3 000 and 4 000 per hectare .
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the areas to continue for quite some time .
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and who think about how to continue their business , " said the mayor .
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced off via the fence promotion .
The open area thus amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be reforested until at least 2023 .
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros , half was financed by Leader , a quarter by the community of Fischerbach .
As a result , the farmers were left with 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of grazing fence .
" The big advantage is the longevity of the fences , " explained Schwendemann .
Kordula Kovac stressed : " you are doing a really good job , you cannot do it without farmers and rural women . "
Peter Weiß was also convinced that " the best food is produced here . "
The Landscape Management Directive ( LPR ) of Baden-Württemberg enables the state to support Weidezäunen .
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
A prerequisite is the existence of a funding framework defined by the LPR .
In addition , the fenced-in area must not be traceable ( slope gradient of more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .
The proposal for the Fisherman 's fence project 2018 is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
Is nothing more sacred ?
Now the Trump White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans value them as much as anyone - hence the carefully orchestrated fall of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad 's Firdos Square in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN 's Jim Acosta over the president 's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration .
To be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .
But he attacked its significance , and in particular the significance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the monument was completed .
When Miller slammed Acosta : " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... A symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world .
The poem you 're referring to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '
Miller is factually correct , but as he put it himself , it 's not really about history .
It 's about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " your weary , your poor , / your afflicted masses yearning to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich shores . "
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump 's US .
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is , in fact , a conflict over the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who lobbied for her words to be placed at the base after her death - knew very well that she was doing a highly political act .
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical pictorial representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .
Linking the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it a long time ago .
The great writer Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone , but rather was an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame to the dying world : " lady Liberty is moving forward .
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
The torch is not meant to light the road to the United States . "
Rather unusually , Limbaugh came across something here .
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception .
The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .
It 's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
And , of course , that 's not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge .
Their torch is not to light the way , but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power .
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will " make a massive contribution to the team . "
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , which kicks off on Friday .
Black believes that " something special is developing in Scotland " and UK Athletics needs to learn something from it .
" We welcome it , and we 're trying to understand it , and we 'll keep doing it until we find out , " black said .
" I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it 's something to do with what they 've done .
The Scottish athletes think it 's something to do with what they 've done .
British Athletics : it 's something to do with what they 've done .
And also with the type on the street corner .
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it 's absolutely brilliant . '
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track , while Eilidh Doyle was voted team captain by the team .
" Eilidh is pretty modest .
Your captain 's speech was unbelievable , " says Black .
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally was great . "
The Commonwealth silver medallist , who will compete in her fifth world championships in the 400m hurdles , says it is " unbelievable " that 16 Scots are in the British team .
Scotland 's best ever total of athletes at the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way , setting five British and two European records last year .
She will take part in the 1,500m and 5,000m races .
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell .
The team captain says she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team , but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals .
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me , " she added .
" Obviously I 'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team .
It just shows how far we 've come .
And they 're here as established athletes , athletes who want to get on podiums .
As for my speech as captain ?
Yeah , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup .
So it 's really important to put on that home support and benefit from us being back at the Olympic Stadium .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it 's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there . '
Blocking critics via Facebook : don 't bid for public office if you can 't stomach hoarding voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press .
Americans loved George Washington , but it wasn 't long before newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles .
He sneered at the criticism , sure .
But he has not silenced his critics .
For in 1783 , Washington said , " freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are led to slaughter like sheep . "
Which brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who needs to work to be more like Washington .
Hogan 's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week .
The governor 's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " nah , and ? . "
" It 's just Facebook , " a lot of people said .
But it 's important .
And it 's especially important when it 's a guy like Hogan .
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular .
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation 's 50 governors .
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles .
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playfully debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side .
Therefore , blocking people coming to the governor 's side - which is a public forum designated as official and staffers paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan 's spokeswoman , Amelia Chasse , defended the governor 's actions , arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation .
But it 's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people wielding the whip online .
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , not trolls .
They all said their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other breaking news , " she wrote in the commentary section of The Post .
" I don 't appreciate this idea either , when a number of people take a position on the same subject , some people disrespect it as a so-called collective effort rather than being recognised as a large group of concerned citizens . "
What the governor 's aides called a " concentrated spam attack , " others would likely call " advocacy . "
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .
It is much cleaner than in the past to have done the same by sending staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters .
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slamming Facebook and other social media outlets .
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
One of the first milestones on the issue fell in Virginia last week .
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
It shouldn 't be that hard .
At the time of Washington , the era of the affordable port had a similar effect to the Internet .
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers seized his leadership .
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juricola , " " Valerius , " " Belisarius , " and " Portius " all wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .
Petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .
But he did not silence them .
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are at the heart of our nation .
And true leadership means accepting that .
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
The Northern Irishman , who led next door at Archerfield Links to the final before losing to Paul Eales last year , is linked to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club 's founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvadi .
" I saw the Renaissance Club being built and we see it achieving its glory with this event , " Rafferty said .
" The players will see this course from his best side , he 's in a great state .
Jerry did a great job in fixing this place .
He is a fervent supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
This is a great showcase for this course . "
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career .
" It feels really special , " said the Southport resident .
" I haven 't been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out the year after I won it .
Coming back to this part of the world is magical .
It 's a wonderful place to play golf .
The memories from last year are coming back , and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year .
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish . "
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday , returns to action on home soil .
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .
" You want to do well , but you also feel that extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played solid golf .
I 'm happy with how things have gone so far . "
With the trio in the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field , the others being Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond .
Admission is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with one occupant and £ 10 per car with two or more occupants .
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK .
Fewer lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking .
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) have come to this conclusion in a study .
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths a year are due to passive smoking , " said study leader Heiko Becher .
By way of comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .
At the time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
Home connections turn out to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Strasse is in full swing and " somewhat in time , " according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
Traffic , which repeatedly obstructs construction work , is a major problem for the construction team of the Stumpp company .
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and grilles is already enormous , " reports Heinze .
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through .
Angelo Caruso , Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks .
" The hot days were quite exhausting .
But luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , " says Marvin Kostorz .
Poverty and Death in Indonesia 's Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner , she doesn 't use a stove .
In fact , it rarely uses a pot .
At her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of Paniai rule in the restive Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually places a sweet potato - known locally as a " nota " - directly in the fireplace .
After half a hour , the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with eager , unwashed hands .
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work , such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp .
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine .
The youngest of her husband 's four wives , she was not assigned fields .
Polygamy is common here .
Of course , working late can be dangerous : most villagers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here .
" Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5pm , " she says .
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was taken in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were to vote through a public hand-wringing vote in front of the occupying forces .
An existing movement that pushed for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island .
Enarotali is as remote as it is barren , with a 90-minute flight from Jayapura , the provincial capital , to Nabire , followed by a five-hour drive in the morning .
There is no public transport .
The town of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust .
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
Before Christian missionaries arrived , Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee .
There were other changes , too .
" We weren 't used to wearing those clothes , " Degei says , pointing to her vibrant hand-woven turban , dark shirt and bright skirt .
" We used to have only leaves on our bodies . "
Papua is Indonesia 's poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .
But it is also Indonesia 's gold country .
The world 's largest and most profitable gold mine , Grasberg , owned by Phoenix 's Freeport McMoran , is just 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000 .
In 2015 alone , Freeport mined $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper .
In addition , Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .
These riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papuans , who ensure that Indonesia 's powerful military maintains a stifling presence .
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly .
Activists say more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped , tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
Mass killings in Papua 's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide , according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights .
In the region alone , Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year .
" We Will All Lost , " says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane that included reports of previous year 's atrocities , such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular , according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations .
" It 's difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week , " says Andreas Harsono , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
The screws have intensified as Papua 's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
The province 's population of 3.5 million is 83 % Christian , but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sulawesi .
Javanese Warung canines sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado , a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce .
Local people are fighting to keep up .
" The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , " explains Abeth You , a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work .
" It cost the native Papua - the Mama-Mama [ the women ] of Papua - their market . "
Indonesian President Joko Widodo , popularly known as Jokowi , promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua .
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua 's 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
But little has changed in Papua , and today locals feel betrayed .
" Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .
In fact , Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokowi 's inauguration in October .
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas songs in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights .
One of the soldiers took offence at their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai .
The soldiers who had been drinking chased and beat the group with their rifle butts , victims and witnesses said .
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
One child , 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma .
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day .
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua 's Mee Pago tribe .
Some protesters began hurling stones at police and military posts .
As the mood heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : " when the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " according to an official document seen by TIME , which was not released to local media .
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the impending danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home .
No one was in the mood to listen .
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , " he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house .
Kayame still doesn 't know who fired , but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here .
" It was crowded , a lot of shots were fired , " he adds .
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times , according to his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .
" I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him , " Yohanes , who like many Indonesians has only one name , told TIME in gloomy mood .
" I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . "
The chief inspector of Papua police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers only wanted to " secure " her station because she was being attacked .
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015 .
" It 's about life and death . "
Five young protesters were killed and many more injured , according to Human Rights Watch .
News of the killings only came " filtered " to Jakarta the following day .
For three weeks , Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura , expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua .
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won 't happen in the future , " he said .
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights abuses .
But the excuses started almost immediately .
" Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .
Some were in the 90s and early 2000 's .
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 , saying he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua .
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .
Wiranto , whom the U.N. has accused of " crimes against humanity " that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor 's bloody 1999 independence vote , said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been resolved , including the Paniai incident .
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity .
" I 've been interviewed four times in the last three years , but there 's been no progress whatsoever , " Yohanes says .
" I 'm tired . "
He says that years later he is still living in fear .
" I 'm scared , " he says .
" I 'm afraid of being arrested by the military , I 'm afraid of being shot . "
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
" After I buried the bodies , the military searched for me , " he says .
The shootings have not stopped .
On Tuesday , Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai 's Deiyai neighborhood .
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
The man , 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned while fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
Excited villagers protested outside the company 's location office .
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots .
But locals say the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began shooting at the crowd , killing one .
" We were so panicked , we 're afraid there will be revenge , " says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being quickly hospitalized here , according to TIME .
" I hid in my house for two days . "
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area .
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government .
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribesmen Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal , who live in the green highlands of Papua .
Many joined the " free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend Papua rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .
In response , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of " safeguarding national sovereignty . "
Some never appear again .
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place . "
Poverty increases discontent .
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .
Bread is just as out of reach .
People here grow everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables .
Agriculture is the job of women , who can work four or five sweet potato fields at a time .
They keep most of the crop for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport .
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and more affluent migrants .
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively .
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... Because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , the chairman of the Paniai tribal council .
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .
In addition , restrictions on reporting remain tight for international media .
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for failing to coordinate with related institutions , although they were given rare permission to film .
According to Phelim Kine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi 's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized .
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua 's immediate neighbours .
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the " various and widespread violations " in Papua , including the Paniai shooting .
The same countries have historically supported OPM .
Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group 's accusations , telling journalists in Jakarta : " a democratic system still applies in Indonesia and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases . "
Local people want more foreign governments to take note .
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him " we want freedom , " according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shooting , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papuans , see their vote for Jokowi as a " debt " that he must repay .
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .
Despite the threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance : the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
They know that they may never get justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with his head lowered .
" What else can we do ? "
Fire captures Dubai 's " Torch " skyscraper for second time
A fire found its way through one of the world 's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday , forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337 metre-high , 79-story building .
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building , which is coincidentally called the Torch Tower , in just two years .
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze .
" We were asleep and we got up at the fire alarm and at the screaming of the people .
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " one resident , who gave his name as George , told Reuters .
Dubai 's civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building at around 4.00 am local time ( 00am GMT ) .
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected .
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world .
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding , the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation .
In Britain , police said they believe the system of slabs for insulation and cladding at London 's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people .
No Davis Cup reform : still best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) fell through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the proposal , revolutionary for this sport , to play Davis Cup singles on only two sets of wins , was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .
The five-set classics , which are often very long but also very much appreciated for this reason , are thus preserved in the traditional competition .
63.54 percent of the member states voted for the reform , so the ITF president David Haggerty 's goal was narrowly missed .
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions , " Haggerty said .
They will continue to work on improving the competition .
After many objections , the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place was not even put to the vote .
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : for example , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round the following year .
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be made easier and the players will have to make fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items to plane , poll finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades .
Less than 1 percent said they had belatedly discovered they had traveled by mistake with firearms , ammunition or explosives .
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - Also found that younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules .
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 percent were Millennials , compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through the security checkpoint , while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane .
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose .
It 's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who fly most frequently .
The company points out , however , that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
So it 's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids .
For a while , people thought the TSA could view books as contraband .
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
Elon Musk doesn 't care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " model 3 . "
So far , he has omitted the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their no-obligation reservation .
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales growth and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different , less dazzling figure when he announced the latest quarterly results : the cancellation of the new mass-market Model 3 .
Over the past few months , Musk has frequently advertised the new car , which is about to be delivered , with more than 500,000 pre-orders .
Now Musk admits : 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn .
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro ( 1000 U.S. dollars in the USA and 1000 pounds in the UK ) " reservation payment " in full .
Currently there are 455,000 such no-obligation reservations , Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts .
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around 12 percent of all orders so far could be a problem .
His argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .
In 2018 - all models put together - it is to be 500,000 , in 2020 it is to be one million .
The demand for this is obviously there .
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
Those who order a " model 3 " today will not be able to expect delivery until the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum capacity without major interruptions .
Many experts doubt that this is possible .
But if there are major delays , the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla .
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves .
EPA chief Pruitt resigns over delaying Obama-Era rules to cut emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants .
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations .
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous job in a federal appeals court .
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth . "
Pruitt , who was an Oklahoma prosecutor before being appointed by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of tougher environmental regulations .
Since arriving in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose .
Wednesday 's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback to Pruitt 's regulatory rollback agenda .
Last month , a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .
In an opinion released Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his about-face on ozone standards simply bolsters EPA 's willingness to work with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to meet implementation deadlines and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
" We don 't believe in regulation through litigation , and we take deadlines seriously .
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . "
Still , the EPA 's opinion said that at some point , Pruitt will use his " power of delay and all other legally available powers " to ensure that the rules are " based on sound policy and the best information available . "
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone rules .
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years .
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate .
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week , said the group planned to maintain legal pressure .
" The EPA 's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important health and safety benefit for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities , " Schneiderman said .
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia in this case .
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year .
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt 's surprise change of course .
" It 's troubling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .
" We must continue to fight the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to align with polluters and their particular interests . "
Tummel celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.30 p.m.
Due to its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
The friends and patrons of Tumlingens have made it their concern to save and preserve the oldest building in the town .
Walter Martini emphasizes : " it 's an unique village gem . "
In 1267 , the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch : Count Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Marks of silver .
According to the text of the deed , in addition to the former parish church , there was a stately court on Tumlingen Mountain , to which the church or the right of patronage belonged , and not the other way round .
People also lived there .
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " Berg " was the third , the stately settlement core of the village .
Old maps dating back to around 1600 substantiate this historical fact .
The right of patronage was born out of the early medieval right of the church .
A gentleman , who built a church , equipped it and occupied it with a parish priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this own church .
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose to the bishop a new pastor .
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
The greatest of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673 .
The newly purchased bell sounded for the first time in 1692 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .
During the 30-year war ( 1616-1648 ) , the window panes were broken and the bell cords stolen .
The roof was leaking .
In 1796 , French troops camped near the church .
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood .
Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler .
In 1823 , the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished .
Only the church tower was left standing .
On New Year 's Eve 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half collapsed .
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was demolished .
Only the tower yard , which still exists today , was preserved as a witness to the church 's history , which is 750 years old .
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the " Schaffigen Pensioners " are in charge of the Hilarius plant in place of Dieter Dockhorn .
On Sunday , 16 July , the friends and supporters of Tumlingens will be hosting the sixth serenade at the old cemetery of St. Hilarius Chapel .
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word .
The program will begin at 4 : 30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade , a drink will take place in front of the cemetery .
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest , " the organisers point out the fantastic view .
The serenade takes place only in dry weather .
The organisers hope that many supporters will support the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tummies and people with hearing disabilities .
Friends and patrons of Tumlingen are particularly committed to home care , as confirmed by Serenade organiser Walter Martini .
Association wants approval of wind turbines to be tested
" Boisheim is resisting " does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore appealed to the county council .
The association " Boisheim resists " has asked Councillor Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette .
It was done illegally .
The association argues that at the time of the approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette , because at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city boundary with Schwalmtal .
Within this zone of concentration , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the zone of concentration results in the exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area .
Such zones are intended to prevent the " sparing " of the landscape .
A few days earlier , the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by amending the land use plan - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf due to a lack of form .
" Due to the lack of a legal basis for planning , the issued approval is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim resists . "
Current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; approval of the district government has yet to be granted .
Erkens : " at this point , the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law . "
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .
" The relevant letters have been received by Viersen County since last week , " a spokesman said .
The group takes the opportunity to re-examine the matter .
However , they are unlikely to bring the proceedings to a halt .
With regard to ongoing proceedings before the Administrative Court , the District did not intend to comment on the content of the argument of the Boisheim Association on Thursday .
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four wind turbines , each 200 metres high , on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
With the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11,400 households is to be met - which corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity demand of all 4-person households .
New Re plans to invest around 20 million euros .
Last summer , Viersen 's city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County .
Car and tractor crash : woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel ( Rhein-Lahn-Kreis ) .
One woman was fatally injured .
Two other people were slightly injured .
The state road remained closed for hours .
According to the police , a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was driving the L 333 in the direction of Bogel with her car while accompanied by her 53-year-old mother .
City and shopkeepers plan " home shopping " weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the residents to go shopping in the city centre .
As the president of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the " Heimat-Shoppen " weekend is intended to sensitize customers to which offers their own city has aside from the usual supermarket goods .
The plan is for a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
In addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
In addition , the shops of the inner city are to invite you to " midnight shopping . "
At the same time , the action does not only target residents of the city and the surrounding region .
In the pipeline are commercials on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action , according to Christian König .
Municipal authorities and trade associations cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
As a result , the Gewerbeverein and the city are entering a further stage of the " attractive city centre " project .
This includes new offers such as the first " activity Day " for the Well Festival , including Sunday open for sale , talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to actively participate .
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiving of parking fees on that day are also part of the concept .
In addition , customer potential is to be rediscovered or rediscovered .
This includes spa guests and tourists .
But many locals also lost sight of the city centre when shopping .
In the end , everyone would have to help revitalize the city center - including landlords , the businesses of the entire city and clubs .
It is necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy , which has partly spread , King said in the spring .
Birgit Stafford , head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühlhausen , announced that five Thuringian cities are taking part for the first time in Germany 's third " Heimat-Shoppen " day .
In addition to Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .
The day should " promote the appreciation of local commerce and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities , " Stafford said .
The action , under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and with many partners , also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her immediate surroundings with his or her buying behaviour .

Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been released by The Washington Post .
On January 27 , Trump , in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , called for him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall .
The U.S. president slammed him for publicly denouncing the wall , reportedly saying to him : " you can 't tell the press that . "
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project .
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released , revealing a tense exchange .
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take refugees who emigrated to Australia was " ridiculous , " " Mies " and " stupid , " and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a " Depp " after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull , " this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . "
Moore 's Ford Massacre : activists resurrect racist lynching act as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumbled onto Moore 's Ford Bridge .
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with rifles stepped out to block its path .
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windscreen .
Indoors , the inmates hovered in fear .
" We want this n -- -- r Roger ! " The man roared .
" Get him out of the car ! "
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat .
Luckily , this horrific scene , played on July 22 , is just a reenactment .
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of " Roger , " almost everyone in the audience breathed very real sighs .
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .
No one has ever been charged with the murders .
" It 's really unfathomable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize the reenactment .
'it 's a smear on a story , but it 's a burden on our souls . '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist .
For him , the obituary serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
" We want prosecution , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , " he said .
" We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice . "
A forensic doctor puts a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford syndrome on 27 July 1946 .
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process , according to FBI files obtained by NBC News .
But none have ever been charged .
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary .
At about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcom 's wife , Dorothy , and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband .
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .
But as they walked away from the prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynch mob surrounded the car .
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings , " concludes a FBI report .
" It is also evident that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that not only participated in the killings , removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses . "
Brooks puts it even more succinctly .
" It was an electoral rights massacre , " he said .
" They were all killed for sending a message to black people in this community : " if you register and if you vote , that 's going to happen to you here . " "
For nearly a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .
Their portrayal is vivid , poignant and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America .
It 's hard to watch , and even harder to look away from , but Greene said that 's the point .
" We don 't want to talk about lynching , because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .
" But I can 't build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or not want to hear what I 've been through . "
Rehearsals for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play .
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-director here .
He has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said the role never gets easier .
" I feel dirty because I 'm not like that , " Marbaugh said .
'But I think it 's very important to keep this story alive because we don 't want to go back to those times . '
Across the room , actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , rehearsed their lines .
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and heckling him , angry that he slept with his wife , Dorothy .
" I said , n -- - er , get away from my property ! "
Rascona retorts the fire .
There is a pause .
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) erupts into laughter .
Greene laughs the loudest .
" What ? ! " Asked Rascona .
He is alarmed and confused .
Was I too hard ?
" No , " Greene said , still giggling .
" I just don 't think white people said " n -- - er " at the time . "
" Yes , " quipped one of the other black performers .
" You just have to hit the hard " R. " "
And that 's where the energy in the room shifts , a sense of comradeship replaces discomfort .
Everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .
The scene begins again .
This time , when Rascona says the N-word , he says it sharply and forcefully .
Absolutely no one is laughing .
This repetition ends violently and quickly .
There are screams , shots and then silence .
A woman , dressed in a mourning dress , stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays ' mourning eulogy " strange Fruit . "
Her voice breaks at every second word .
About a hundred metres behind them , a group of about four dozen spectators wiped sweat and tears from their eyes .
The audience is split almost evenly between black and white .
A couple arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many coming down the street .
They all experienced Georgia 's oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys .
Up to this point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now , standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels ghostly .
When the final notes of the song end , Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse .
Children are hovering on their heads , recording the fake blood and the silent bodies , and whispering to each other .
" They 're not really dead , " one little boy mumbles as if to remember .
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears .
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then collapses in their arms crying , the emotional burden of performing eventually collapses on him .
" It 's okay , " whispers one of the women .
" We know it 's not in your heart .
You did it for a reason . "
Later , the audience sits down with the actors for dinner .
At a table , a white couple from Atlanta chatted animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they had just met .
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about what feeling the performance left .
" It 's hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... Coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , " she said .
" What this really does to me makes me think that the lynching is still going on , " she added , " today it 's just called police shootings . "
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks keeps Brooks ' farm at his table , he eats and recalls civil rights .
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .
" The obituary is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we 've endured , but it 's also a moment of learning , " he said .
" It 's like if we don 't learn anything from it , it can happen again .
Those who do not study their own history , those who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . "
" Götterdämmerung " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner 's monumental work , director Frank Castorf also focuses on a colourful , frivolous performance against a gigantic , six-story backdrop .
The revolving stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) optionally shows a shabby street corner with the rest of the wall and the Dönerbude in Berlin , a " plaste and Elaste " logo from the times of the GDR , or the New York Stock Exchange .
In front of it there is an open Mercedes classic car , in which the daughters of the Rhine pose as rocker girls , or alternatively an Isetta .
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which runs through his " ring " staging .
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully , as in " Rheingold . "
They seduce Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and give the Krawallo clique .
Stephen Milling sings the delightfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer .
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried .
Later , Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) has to believe it .
The audience thanks the ensemble with loud applause .
Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in stormy fashion , who bows modestly and forcefully to Merkel-Raute .
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which will perform on stage for the first time - again in casual casual attire in the face of the great heat .
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited .
Had he had yet to perform a gelling whistle concert in 2013 , there was great cheer five years later , in which the sporadic " BuH " calls subsided .
Festival director Katharina Wagner may have been pleased .
" You notice that the audience has grown up with the " ring " in a way , " she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but has also grown an understanding of his point of view .
I draw a positive conclusion .
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year .
Where to go ?
Crowd : normally in Steinfurt in the Furniture Exchange , once a week I help out here in Greven in the Furniture Bridge .
And I have already worked at the school in an open day .
What are your experiences with it ?
Crowd : it 's a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I am dealing with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
They are now 26 years old , so a late-career volunteer .
How does this come about ?
Crowd : I graduated from high school .
And then a civil engineering degree , let 's say , successfully dropped out .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
And then I asked myself , what are you doing ?
Make a social year , there is an insight , you can see how it really is on the ground , in the focal point , perhaps .
And was it ?
Crowd : I got great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester .
I will be studying dual education , will probably be doing social work training at Herne Youth Office and will be studying at Hamm University of Applied Sciences .
Is it not unusual to have several different places of work during the volunteer service ?
Quantity : yes , it is very variable .
It probably always comes down to where you do your FSJ .
You can do it from nursing homes to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work .
With me , it was very varied .
I was also part of the OGS , that is , in the afternoon care .
For me , this was exactly the right thing that irritated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes .
Unlike in civil engineering studies ?
Crowd : well , this is not about calculating stats .
You always have other people in your head , each of whom has a very different story behind them .
Whether a refugee , or an adolescent who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
Very interesting .
And you had no fear of touching ?
Crowd : I 'm not the type for that .
It 's an area that gives you a lot .
A lot of love , a lot of kindness .
There are sometimes negative moments , but that 's the way life is .
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it will cut a further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressures facing the company .
The job cuts , which director general John Fallon mostly announced for late 2018 and early 2019 , come in addition to his previous restructuring , which has already seen 4,000 job losses .
In a third cost-cutting programme in May , Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 394 million ) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning .
The company , which last month sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann , said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after growing 1 percent to £ 2.05 billion in the first half .
Kabul convoy attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killing one Nato soldier and injuring several others , officials say .
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , a statement from NATO said .
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district .
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday .
On Monday , a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
A statement from Nato said the explosion on Thursday evening happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a " improvised explosive device worn by persons . "
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield .
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram .
According to the United Nations , there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
In late July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul .
The Taliban said they carried out that attack .
On May 31 , a huge bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country 's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001 .
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation by the Obama administration requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions , a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move .
The EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to move forward with what it called " ozone Regulations 2015 " and said it showed the agency 's commitment to work with states .
" We believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , " EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement .
In June , Pruitt announced the EPA 's intention to delay for a year until October 2018 the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards .
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states , along with the District of Columbia , filed suit Tuesday , saying the effort was illegal .
President Donald Trump 's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is intended to boost economic growth .
The effort , however , has drawn pushback from Democrats and conservation groups , who worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
The EPA 's website says that breathing in air that contains ozone " can reduce lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .
Local council wants community space
In the end , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future residential complex for senior citizens .
Before the discussion , there is an important piece of information : the contract for the purchase of the missing piece of land has been signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .
Although it will still take time for the area previously belonging to the parish to be in municipal ownership , there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be carried out by a private investor .
There is a discussion on this in relation to a Community area .
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
On the ground floor , he would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with as much as 70 square metres of space for a special price .
The administration and the majority of the council plan not to provide such a common space as a meeting place only for residents of senior-friendly housing , but to enter openly into the community .
As an example , the word " knitted café " made the rounds .
The decision , which was pre-decided by the allocation of funds for the current budget last autumn , is sweetened by funding opportunities .
The building is located in the redevelopment area .
The creation of a community space would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent , reports Tjaden .
The proposal for a resolution , in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a spanner between his legs in this respect , provides for the observation that both the saddle - which is related to the surrounding construction - and the pedestal roof - which reduces the height of the trunk and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
It is not only Wilfried Sohmer who thinks that this addition is unnecessary .
If it helps : unanimously , he passes the board .
The common space is not as simple as that .
Daniela Ruf points to the many buildings of her own , with which it is not possible to make much progress , but she says : " I am struggling with this . "
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of community space - but absolutely against community participation .
It sees this as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
That is not the case , because with the purchase of the area , one does not give a subsidy , but gets a real value , which can be sold in case of doubt , says the counter-argument .
There are three supporters of Staiger 's motion to split the proposed resolution accordingly .
So there are two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller summed up as follows : " if we take the decision in this way , we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . "
Collision with car : cyclist is thrown onto road
An 82-year-old cyclist was struck by a car while crossing the road in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured .
According to the police , the 82-year-old Langenfelder was riding his bicycle on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 pm .
The senior wanted to cross the road at Am Buchholzer Busch .
A car driver travelling in the same direction gave him priority .
When the Langenfelder drove into the street , he obviously did not pay attention to oncoming traffic .
He collided with a car driving a 66-year-old Hildenerin .
The man was thrown into the street .
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital with a retouch car .
FC Bayern Munich must do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him : David Alaba has to let the game against Dortmund sour .
With personnel concerns , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
Seven pros are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the Cup winner .
The personnel worries at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger ahead of the Supercup on Saturday ( 8.30pm / ZDF and Eurosport ) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund .
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to give up on David Alaba in a duel with BVB .
The Italian confirmed this on Friday .
In addition , the miners are missing Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat .
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches , Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team 's game .
" We know we are not in the best physical condition , " Ancelotti said , adding : " the most important point is the balance in the team .
It was not good in the end . "
However , the 58-year-old believes in an improvement in performance in the first official must-win game of the season .
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities .
The team is ready .
We want to play smart , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intense game . "
The duel between the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans .
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators , the German Football League ( DFL ) announced on Friday .
Walking from star to star in the harp
The first " star Trail " is to be created in the Harz region throughout Germany .
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
A " star trail " meets the information needs of many visitors to Harz , it was said .
It combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance .
The members want to set up signs along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well-attainable installations in five to six places " in the Upper Harz .
St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible .
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet .
For this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .
Accessibility is also a criterion .
Later , the star trail Zug is to be extended by train .
" On the star trail , the viewers will learn a lot about the physics of the individual stars , for example , " explained the association .
They also learned why stars have different colors , or why one star shines more strongly than another , even though it is much further away .
It is also conveyed in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it .
Since 2014 , the association has operated the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .
From there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be seen with the naked eye .
Since 2003 , the Uni-Stadt has had something similar to the planned Starwerg - the Planetary Trail - on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen .
Starting in front of Gebhard 's Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stelae leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as a " alien " location in Diemarden ( Gemeinchen Gleichen ) with the planet Sedna .
The stelae with the individual planets - including Pluto , which has been reduced to a dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion .
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the sun , which stands exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimetres .
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto .
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in space .
The march to the next fixed star , however , would take another six months .
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia , the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion , walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion .
After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list .
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said , " how are you , champion ?
I wish you good luck . "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga at 7 p.m. on ESPN on Saturday night .
As the pair posed for photos , Lomachenko manager Egis Klima noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of magnitude . "
" I 'm a former featherweight , " recalled Garcia .
" I went up for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not that big .
I 'm small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
And he has to move on lightweights [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .
That 's what the fans are demanding .
Let 's give them that . "
Lomachenko agreed .
" Boxing needs this fight . "
Klima asked if it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their light-heavyweight title fight at the Forum on September 23 .
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it , " Garcia said , later expressing himself openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package .
We are the best .
No other names can generate that kind of attention .
Whenever they 're ready ... "
Garcia said he rates Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter , " and he may participate in his Saturday fight .
But Lomachenko stopped at the lavish praise for Garcia , saying that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks " very slow , sorry Mikey ... You wanted to get out . "
Garcia said the focus is to show batting strength , then boxing .
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight .
" This is the fight that needs to be done .
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I 'm more than happy to work on it , " Garcia said .
Lomachenko said : " I 've been waiting for the top fighters and that 's Mikey .
It will be a great fight . "
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were partially seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon .
According to initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreite junction , presumably after a tire burst .
The car hurtled to the right into the embankment , where it fell over and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident .
During the initial care of the injured by the ambulance service , the A7 was closed in the direction of the north for about a hour , after which the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
Fortunas Hoffmann : " triple chain works better "
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2-2 start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will bring points .
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season , with the result as well , had there not been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
" These were two opponents too many , and we have to be even more careful in Aue , " says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf .
In the Ore Mountains , the triple chain is to be further optimised .
And a goal after a free kick , the Fortunen don 't want to capture either .
" For the future , it will be the case that no one will line up next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the triple chain , even after the experience gained in the preparation , than with the quadruple .
" I don 't know yet how we 're going to operate in Aue , " says his coach , Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is certain of his cause , " because we 've got players in the middle positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well , " Hoffmann said .
" The prerequisite , however , is that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many errors in the construction . "
Of course , Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .
" But whether one can speak of a failed start after a draw , does not know .
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .
" But if we can come away with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season . "
His coach didn 't want to know about that .
" I don 't judge the start of the season until six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm .
" Now they can virtually start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher as they wouldn 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an upstart favourite in the bone .
" But they don 't know 100 percent where they are at the moment , " says the Fortuna 's defense attorney .
It is true that the guests from the Rhineland will go to the meeting on Sunday in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue as a slight favourite .
" The fact that we sweep them away just because we claim to be in the top six is nonsense , " says Funkel , whose record in only one defeat against Aue in nine matches is entirely positive .
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start , " explains Fortuna 's head coach .
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant . "
And so Funkel certainly doesn 't want to see his players on Sunday .
New results of the Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) began conducting the tests last year .
During the asylum procedure , they are to make the assessment of the age more accurate , after the Swedish Migration Board ( Migrationsverket ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage .
To date , Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .
Eighty percent ( in 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was " possibly 18 years or older . "
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under the age of 18 . "
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
" We don 't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are pretty consistent , " he told The Local magazine .
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean the asylum seeker lied about their age .
In May , the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that " suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older . "
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases , the person had openly said that he would turn 18 this year .
The method of medical age assessment , which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing people 's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual .
" I had reason to think about it , and I don 't think the type of measurement should be used .
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .
If we can 't say it for sure , we shouldn 't pretend we can , " he told Metro newspaper .
However , Göransson , of the Forensic Medicine Agency , defended the accuracy of the tests : " in general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case it 's about 10 percent . '
Full on schedule
Work is progressing well on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg .
On Wednesday , a seven tonne concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .
" We 're very good at the time , it 's going great , " says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the department of road and transport in the Freiburg regional council .
In April , work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation .
The construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be met .
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , crosses the Trombach .
It is an arched concrete bridge clad in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres .
It was built in 1900 .
Like the other two bridges , it has come into its own .
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three structures will now be thoroughly renovated .
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach river .
They are made of red sandstone .
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 or 10.60 metres long .
On Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach received a bridge cap on the north side , 1.30 metres wide and weighing seven tonnes .
This is a fringe attachment , which is also used as an operating route .
A 2.20-metre wide bridge cap is to be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday .
The pedestrian path should then run along it .
The special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
The laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach required a special sensitivity .
There is also a fibre optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by leaflets .
In addition , fish and crabs had to be fished first .
For the bridges between the Bauhofgebäude and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a single traffic light .
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " seven Linden " is fully blocked .
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros .
The whole thing is financed by the country .
AFD in Gerolstein : colourful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconcile .
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel ( CDU , SPD , Greens , FDP , FWG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which on this day shows a peaceful flag , because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster " great campaign launch . "
And celebrities - such as Alice Weidel , who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch .
But those who are there hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD people , they want to demonstrate .
The motto " the Eifel stays colourful . "
Originally , the city picnic under the motto " all at one table " was planned on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .
A colorful picture that can be seen here .
And what Christa Karoli , president of the One World Forum and one of the leading organizers , is really looking forward to : " great how many people have come together here . "
There is music and plenty of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could easily eat , " says the woman who brought him .
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein , they are mainly present at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
How did the AfD actually come across Gerolstein ?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he tried to hold such an event and was awarded the contract .
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for Daun , but received a cancellation there , because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Laurentiuskirmes that had already been built .
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a beautiful event here . "
Looking at the event on Rondellvorplatz , he says : " this is the right of the people , the main thing is that it remains peaceful . "
It does , too : at around 8 p.m. , a band provides entertainment on Rondellvorplatz , and various speakers in the Stadthalle , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge .
There are around 200 listeners in the room waiting for the federal election 's top candidate , Alice Weidel , and Storch 's deputy federal chair , Beatrix von Storch , to deliver their speeches .
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officers have had a quiet evening .
The AfD event lasts a little more than a hour , the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath , but there is also a tidy up shortly after 9 pm .
The police can leave - no special occurrences .

There will be a reunion with the Wolf-based trombonist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslach Monastery Concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto " Schwarzmeer meets Schwarzwald , " or even " Balkanfolklore " meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras .
Petkov is the principal trumpeter of the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the principal trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
Both combine the desire not only to transcend the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds as if in a new guise , Daniel Schnyder 's " world Music " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece " exchange Suite " by jazz musician Nils Wogram , classical music , jazz and free play combine to form a fascinating work of art .

The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
" Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
But I want to try everything , " Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality .
" Once I bite into grilled cheese , I think , " Oh that was cool , what 's next ? . " "
The most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her " twilight " colleague Robert Pattinson , which ultimately came to a bitter end .
Despite all this , the brunette actress assures the " Harper 's Bazaar " magazine : " I was seriously in love with everyone I datet .
Or do you think I played it ? "
After their separation , Kristen admitted that she was bisexual : " I 've always lived and seriously believed in dualism .
So it has never confused or hindered me .
I just never liked not being taken seriously . "
According to " bang Showbiz , " she suffered particularly in school , when she preferred to dress like a boy : " not all girls are typical girls .
It really hurt me a lot .
When I was eleven , the children told me I looked like a lad .
I felt really attacked , scared and ashamed .
Now I look back and think to myself , " Girl , be proud of you ! . "
She doesn 't like to explain her love life to the public in particular : " people expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me .
And maybe some people call me ungrateful , but I don 't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public . "
West Virginia governor announces he is changing party
. West Virginia 's Democratic governor , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would be changing the party .
Like it or not , Democrats have moved away from me , " governor Justice said .
" Today I 'm going to tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thought ... Today I 'm going to tell you , as a West Virginia resident , I can 't help you anymore if I 'm a Democratic governor . "
The rally erupted in cheers .
" Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans , " Justice added .
" As a coach , I would say it 's time to play another game . "
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points , and Justice did not approve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who Forbes said is the only billionaire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal deal from his father .
It is worth about $ 1.59 billion .
Meanwhile , the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying , " governor Justice 's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would hinder rather than work to make our country great again . "
" With only 15 governorships and the control of the fewest legislatures in history , Governor Justice 's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive , unifying message , " RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement .
Coe praises " honest " Russian apology over doping scandal
The world 's head of athletics , Sebastian Coe , on Thursday praised what he described as an apparent apology from Russia over a doping scandal , but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated to the sport .
Russia 's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country 's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .
He said he was sorry for " all the athletes who have been stripped of gold and silver medals in competitions . "
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " IAAF president Coe told reporters .
" The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized that it had experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reorganized . "
Coe said he was also " pleased " that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement .
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the task force 's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " Coe said .
" We must do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation .
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the rotten system , " he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players in the World Athletics Championships , which begin in London on Friday , according to the strict IAAF criteria .
The head of the IAAF task force , Rune Andersen , said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement .
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to operate , he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council .
Funeral for soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hesse , around 1,000 people commemorated the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about the outstanding cause of the crash .
However , she described the two pilots killed as " experts in their field . "
" We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany , " she said .
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter cathedral on Thursday , accompanied by a death guard from the Bundeswehr .
At noon , at first , only the relatives in the church said goodbye .
After that , the funeral began in the family circle , close friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politicians .
Among them were Hesse 's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the inspector general of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .
Funeral guests laid roses , and the family members stood arm in arm at the coffins .
In front of the church , Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas .
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the killed soldiers as " highly decorated " and deployed .
The chief of staff had helped to set up the flight operations of the Tiger helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment .
Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong , also declared : " if this occupation could not avert the crash , then no one would have succeeded . "
Minister von der Leyen did not doubt the U.N. mission in Mali : the deployment was dangerous .
But he is also of high importance " for a country from which we are separated only by two states , " she said .
After the funeral , the coffins were taken from the cathedral .
The Bundeswehr did not provide any information as to when and where they will be buried .
Prince Henrik doesn 't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Queen Margrethe of Denmark ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
This was announced by the royal court on Thursday .
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral of Roskilde .
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two .
The Queen agreed with her husband 's decision , the statement continued .
It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried .
However , he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
He would have liked to become king after his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972 .
He retired in 2016 and is also entitled " Prinzgemahl . "
Since Henrik was not given the title and the function he wanted in Denmark , he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death , explained Lene Balleby , the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house .
Where the 83-year-old 's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear , he said .
However , he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , son of a noble French family , Margrethe met in London in 1965 .
On the Thames , he worked in the French embassy .
While his later wife always received popular sympathies , Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes in his nearly 50-year reign .
In an autobiography of his first years in Denmark , Henrik said : " a few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticised .
My Danish was wavering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knitted socks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
Even for the Gauloises , who smoked tobacco instead of Virginia-tobacco and who had a reputation in this country for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals , I could not hope for leniency .
I was different .
I seemed happy with that position and not ashamed .
These were two mistakes ! "
Prime Minister Weil wants early re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Following the loss of the red-green government majority , Lower Saxony 's Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a swift re-election of the state parliament , but he does not want to resign .
Because spoke on Friday in favour of the dissolution of the parliament .
Earlier , the surprise resignation of a Green MP from her parliamentary party in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
Five months before the official date of the state election , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and FDP .
The former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not nominating for the 2018 election in her constituency of Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she declared in Hanover on Friday .
The leader of the CDU group , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend that his group accept them .
This would give the CDU and FDP a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament , the SPD and the Greens 68 seats .
So far , the relationship has been the other way around .
The new parliament will be elected on 14 January next year .
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil believes , however , that it is essential for the state parliament to decide on its own dissolution as soon as possible .
The CDU group is expected to decide on its next course of action on Tuesday .
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the state parliament removing the trust of the prime minister and electing a successor .
" Our Constitution offers several options .
These options need to be looked at in a legally clean way , " Thümler said .
" All issues will be discussed calmly if they are properly examined by law . "
Thümler called Twesten 's move " a little curious . "
The politician herself insisted : " I am not a traitor .
I feel very good . "
She described herself as a supporter of black and green .
The Greens asked the breakaway MPs to return their country mandate .
" We assume , of course , that she will immediately return her land mandate , which she received via the Green Land List , " said the chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .
The leader of the Green Party , Anja Piel , said : " we very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten . "
She deliberately chose not to hold a debate in the group .
" Even against the background that there were no substantive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . "
SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz denounces the transfer of Lower Saxony 's Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .
" The behaviour of the former Green deputies in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters , but also a betrayal of the red-green , " the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly .
Leaving Twesten costs Rot-Grün the majority in Lower Saxony .
The politician put her personal interests before the welfare of the country " in her wounded vanity and frustration , criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil .
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty game of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it . "
The leader of the CDU party in Lower Saxony , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten be admitted to the CDU .
The leader of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Tvwest of falsifying the results of the 2013 state election by means of personal career thinking .
At the time , the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a razor-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .
How could the scandal happen ?
How can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) speaks and answers in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp .
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches .
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , there is practically no risk to health .
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the Federal Minister of Agriculture does not really perceive the central role of the reconnaissance ?
It is the responsibility of the federal states to monitor food .
Nevertheless , my house has opened up without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries ever since the public became aware of Germany 's concern .
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
Retailers , as well as manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health .
If the maximum residue limit of 0.005mg / kg for eggs is exceeded , these are not transportable .
Untainted eggs , however , can be sold and eaten .
This time , it is not the companies that are to blame .
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
According to current knowledge , the production plants are not directly responsible .
Instead , they face economic damage from suspected illegal practices by service providers .
As always , there are not enough inspectors in the event of an emergency .
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of coherent responsibility ?
It was the official controls that uncovered the matter .
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be completely excluded .
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor 's offices in cases where crimes may be committed are of crucial importance .
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information .
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scares ?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food .
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .
The adulterated product has put manufacturers , dealers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and without any gaps .
How football 's financial rules affect Neymar 's move to Paris
The rules , which aim to prevent unimpeded spending by European football clubs , will not disrupt Neymar 's world-record transfer from Spain 's Barcelona to France 's Paris-Saint Germain .
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA , because the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .
Financial fair play rules , created by UEFA in 2011 , mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar 's transfer was funded without major losses .
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year .
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .
PSG can certainly make the money easy for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars , given the team 's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar .
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but must counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business .
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .
The former French player believed clubs who had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support .
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs " debt to monitoring their losses .
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - was to become a tougher one .
During the current three-year FFP investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros .
And although Platini fell out of favor with the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , remains committed to discouraging excessive spending .
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " Andrea Traverso , who is in charge of FFP at UEFA , told The Associated Press last week .
Although PSG paid Neymar 's buy-out clause in a lump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee for the next five years of 44.4 million euros can be included in the annual financial statements .
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions , along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City .
PSG were fined 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that team members be limited to 21 players for the 2014 / 15 Champions League season instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to outwit its financial watchdog by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club .
While a Qatar company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .
That 's exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA 's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out .
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .
UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar 's transfer , people familiar with the situation said on Thursday .
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros .
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be released .
PSG expect Neymar 's arrival to be a boon to sponsorship deals , merchandising and jersey sales .
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go and it tried to prevent Neymar 's departure by claiming that PSG would breach the FFP .
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " the president of the La Liga , Javier Tebas , told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar 's eventual ownership of PSG .
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares La Liga 's reservations about a state funding a club .
" It 's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , " Wenger said on Thursday .
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .
It 's going to be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . "
Swiss is looking for a new school supplier
In recent years , Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss .
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end : the airline is rewriting the order .
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper " Nordwestschweiz " on Friday at the request of the news agency sda .
According to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
" We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " the spokeswoman said .
The flight attendants distribute around 17 million small red-white-packed school boards of 14 grams per year to passengers before landing .
Swiss did not want to give any details about the costs .
According to Northwest Switzerland , industry insiders estimate the order volume at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs .
But more important is the advertising effect : for a school manufacturer , it is a prestigious order .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new competition .
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
For sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board its flights since 2006 .
Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary , Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug .
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey .
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are treated to treats from the Sprüngli Confiserie , Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey .
Swiss Schoggi also distributes Chocolat Frey on the short-haul route , in both business and economy class .
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion is competing for a medal in the final on Saturday .
His brother Christoph , the 2016 Olympic champion , had failed in the national championship draw and could only watch the debate from the stands .
Also with the first attempt , the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski , who threw 65.13 metres , qualified for the final fight .
Nostalgia enters the niche in " wet Hot American Summer " and " comrade Detective . "
This repetition of the story is at once nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s , for the 1990s grunge era ( when the prethinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter were shooting the sketch comedy " the State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to bigger things .
As a cultural artifact , it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories .
But as a franchise , it feels like time is running out .
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humor ( it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing cool kids who grow up - they nevertheless managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke .
" Ten Years Later , " with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more poignant , including a riff on the Stalker films of the 1990s such as " the Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " the Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ) .
At one point , a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a bunch of other things from 1991 . "
Many of the central stories are the same .
The amiable Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now a novelist , still hasn 't forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn 't lost his virginity .
And there is another crazy evil plot involving Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
As always , the exs are the best part of the franchise .
It 's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's underlip of " singles , " whose former big-man on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .
It 's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " seven Up ! " Series until it reaches what I assume to be its logical conclusion : " wet Hot American Summer : twenty Years Later , " whose final scene will show the gang as they attend the film premiere of " wet Hot American Summer . "
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now recalls a different kind of nostalgia : the Cold War revival of " the Americans , " the film " Atomic Blonde , " and even " glow , " with its east-facing West wrestling iconography .
The comedy , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , starring Rhys Thomas as its director , claims to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism .
The leading roles - a hard-edged Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt .
It 's a brilliant idea .
But it 's not much more than an idea .
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of " Find the Voice Out . "
But " comrade Detective " is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one .
Six long episodes are dragging on , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
" Comrade Detective , " which was edited to a lesser length , could better deliver his agitprop satire , as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a pile of hamburgers .
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a fodder for a laugh .
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong : we 're even doing it with our own recent history and theirs .
Blow to drug mafia in the country
The police have dealt a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Wuerttemberg .
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , the public prosecutor 's office in Konstanz announced on Friday .
15 accused , aged between 25 and 77 , have been arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them .
Officers also secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine , firearms and several hundred thousand euros .
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy .
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects .
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation .
A total of more than 300 police officers were on duty .
Members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder and robbery and extortion .
The public prosecutor 's office in Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany since the summer of 2016 .
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo , and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
For this reason , four officers from Palermo accompanied the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning .
The investigation targeted mainly Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia .
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is also likely to be blamed on the gang .
Weise complains of large gaps in the foreign register
" Data from citizens who should not show up " : According to one report , the Foreign Register in Germany has significant shortcomings .
This leads to , in some cases , serious errors of judgment in asylum procedures .
According to a media report , the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , drew attention to major gaps in the immigration central register .
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to " sometimes serious wrong decisions " in asylum procedures and deportations , warned Weise in an analysis available to the " Süddeutsche Zeitung . "
According to data , the register covers ten million people of foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .
The data will therefore be managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
Because the data had not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality in parts had not been good so far .
In individual cases , data from 1921 were found , " by people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register . "
" Incorrect data entry can significantly slow down return processes , " the report said .
The statistics on people who are required to leave also include EU citizens who do not need to leave at all .
Such misattributions , however , " led to a distorted debate about how to deal with expatriates , " according to the analysis .
Meanwhile , the federal government appears to have begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they arrived from there .
According to an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " reports .
According to the paper , the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures " concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . "
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , the paper said , citing the difficult situation on the ground .
Under the Dublin Convention , refugees are the EU state that they first reach .
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .
The Office now writes as justification : " in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly . "
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .
The internal affairs spokeswoman of the Left faction in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : " families with children are threatened with reception conditions that are contrary to human rights due to the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system and a threat to the welfare of the child . "
Final result
The blood donation service has already made a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for other people .
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday .
First and foremost , Jürgen Greule , who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations .
Traditionally , at the council meeting , the congregation pays tribute to the multiple willingness to donate blood .
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers , not to mention selfless , " underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .
" A single blood donation helps several people , " explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , as the canned food is broken down into its components .
For example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach .
" This year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK County Preparedness Manager .
Obviously , the move to the theatre a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each .
Half as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 millilitres of their lifeblood .
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation about a rise .
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " as it maintained interest rates on family incomes amid intensifying pressure .
Policymakers on the Bank 's Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent , with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that the squeeze on household incomes would continue , with inflation still expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
But she signalled that rate rises would become necessary over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .
It will call time on the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £ 15bn more under the scheme - at £ 115bn .
Minutes after the interest rate decision , the bank said : " in the MPC 's central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption . "
On interest rates , she repeated that " some monetary tightening " would be needed to cool inflation and " slightly larger " scale than markets expect .
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
However , the bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited . "
The bank 's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next stand in comparison with May 's forecast of 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent .
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 percent in 2018 .
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro , according to these news reports .
The pound fell 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell 0.4 % to Euro1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after the latest disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for a rate rise and saw GDP rise to 0.3 percent in the second quarter from 0.2 percent in the previous three months .
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year , according to the bank .
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and small pay rises , as tightening gets worse first before improving .
She added that monetary policy could not " prevent " the drop in income over the next few years , but she added that wages will " recover significantly " by the end of her three-year forecast .
The economy is also bolstered by rising demand for British goods , due to the weak pound , which will offset some of lower consumer spending .
The decision comes a year after interest rates fell to 0.25 percent last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to reach prices and the economy in full .
Before the Bank 's latest judgment on interest rates , calls for a rate rise had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5 % in July .
Inflation has dropped to 2.6 percent in the past month from 2.9 percent in June , although the bank said this was expected and it will pick up again in the coming months .
The bank said the excess relative to its 2 % target was " entirely " due to the weak pound .
Andrew Montlake , director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders clamor for deals and want to end the year in a positive way .
The market is looking particularly good for those who are phasing out existing deals and taking out new mortgages , and many with no-fee options and low rates are becoming more popular . "
NHS ( The National Health Service ) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a High Court battle over funding for the drug in the NHS .
NHS England announced that pre-sexual pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent , will now be delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it .
The move , announced on Thursday , was hailed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as a " important new intervention , " while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a " defining moment . "
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up and more clinics will follow in October before being rolled out across England in April 2018 .
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection .
Taking PReP before sexual intercourse means there are just enough drugs in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .
Such medications can be taken every day or so as early as two hours before sexual intercourse .
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .
People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also sign up for possible attendance at their local participating sex clinic .
The program will cost £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted , absorbed and implemented on a large scale .
Stevens said : " this major new intervention should complement and overhaul the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity 's greatest health challenges . "
Deborah Gold , chief executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
PReP , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
From September , people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
We warmly welcome this announcement . "
Ian Green , chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " the priority now has to be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one at risk for HIV to be left behind .
Now that PrEP has been procured , we are well on the way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . "
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " the start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delayed implementation by the Government .
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us move one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . "
Living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .
It 's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it 's testament to the new design that Joanne hasn 't packed and sold her bags .
" Before that , I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space , " says Joanne .
" I was looking for something similar to my price .
I was shown this flat in Earls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day . '
Since the first visit , the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled .
Originally an one-bedroom property with a neat layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height .
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
That was my requirement , " she says .
To that end , she commissioned architecture and design studio Duck & Shed , by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill , to use the 12.5 foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem .
" The steelworks are quite complicated , " he explains .
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other , without having to bend down .
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much additional drama .
For the mezzanine , a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area .
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the programme .
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .
In the kitchen , the mirroring feels like a window into another room .
At the entrance , mirrored units provide space for all Joanne 's cutlery and glasses .
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can shut off the kitchen if not used .
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new .
What 's special about this one is that it 's a garage door .
" A bit of engineering went into it , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .
" It 's counterweight , so when you push the door up , it glides very easily . "
Thanks to clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to gain an extra 16 sq m , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
" At the end of the day , you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued , " says Erfan .
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the floor . "
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .
" You don 't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls .
These are important , but they don 't play with your heart . "
It shows that , with good design and increased square metres , an apartment can transform itself from something standard into something quite amazing .
In fact , like Joanne , you might choose not to leave this one .
Brothers fight over $ 500 million property empire
Two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria 's largest real estate empires , worth more than $ 500 million , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty .
The former director of the " Carlton Football Club " and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided .
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp row over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .
Along with their mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family bought a store in Smith Street , Collingwood , in 1973 .
There , the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
That money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis ' portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the Brunswick and Sorrento development areas , the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments , and suburban shopping malls .
Under an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant figure " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about a third .
A court filing says this means Colin owns $ 316 million worth of property and Paul is worth $ 176 million .
The division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem point for Paul .
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects , " he wrote in an initial affidavit in 2015 .
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin , Paul claims , has ruled him out of .
Colin argues this is not true , but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions .
In an early affidavit filed by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .
" My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority , " he wrote .
Costs are rising in the case , with hundreds of pages of affidavits , emails and reports from companies including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with top lawyers including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family 's first jeans shop .
Colin says he started Westco there when he was " in my final years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons .
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court , " she wrote .
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million when he left the company and Luke $ 26 million .
Both Lukas and Mark were , Paul says , " embittered at the terms of their financial separation . "
Colin has held back very much despite being a former AFL board member and being the TV star 's best friend , according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire .
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .
Only Colin replied by text message to say " I really can 't say much " because the case was before the courts .
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts , " he wrote .
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother 's demands .
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute , " he said , adding that he was " still hoping for a solution . "
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " Colin wrote .
Trump 's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president 's media abstinence .
Others have tried and failed .
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
If so , he will be the first .
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the boss on an even keel .
Here 's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey :
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House chief of staff , met with chief executives on his first day on the job , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump 's White House that he wanted to fix : bad information getting into the president 's hands .
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president " would make better decisions if he got good information . "
Kelly 's diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by overseeing his media diet .
President Trump 's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he 's in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
" If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage from posts that needed convincing , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February .
Politico 's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump 's Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise . "
Okay .
But the idea that Trump 's Twitter habit was ever " under control " is ridiculous .
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don 't know to others - that Trump 's tweets would have contained even more ignominy without their interventions .
We 'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn 't send .
If his collaborators have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times , their efforts have paid off .
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing parties , people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that may promote their views of the world .
Politico - busy with this story - reported in May on the advisors " preference for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons .
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher :
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is eager to find out where they come from .
That 's what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocative Charles C. Johnson , who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a bunch of leaks " in the White House .
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he has offered no specific evidence , or that he has made false accusations in the past and revoked them .
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh . "
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives . "
How did it work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .
These unchanging factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown , the support of the population is requested and hoped for .
Police across Europe are sending ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer .
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature , information from the population is hoped for and requested .
Europol reported on Friday the action , which follows the " EU Most Wanted " advent calendar from the winter .
Experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding in holiday destinations , Europol said .
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together .
The www.eumostwanted website has been around since 2016 and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
Thirty-six of the online requests have so far been arrested , at least eleven of them on the basis of information posted on the website .
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the " millionaire row '
Some of the West Midlands " wealthiest homeowners are once again at loggerheads with some determined travellers who negotiated a ditch drawn by the borough to reclaim a field in front of their mansions .
The travellers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Solihull road , dubbed the " millionaire 's row . "
They brought horses , babies and an army of vans after being thrown out only in May , but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions .
The tactful group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way .
Angry residents have heckled Solihull council , saying it was " useless to deal with the problem . "
An anonymous resident said : " they moved there on Monday evening after being sent on by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones at passers-by .
The Council must be forced into action by shame , because it has been useless in dealing with the problem .
The travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back .
More arrived last night , probably more today . "
She added : " Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks .
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I 'm not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can 't even stop it . '
A local resident , who did not want to be named , said : " it 's ridiculous , we 've just seen the last round of these travellers just to be robbed by another round .
The numbers have increased this time and you 've even seen a horse in the park area . "
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said : " we are aware of an unauthorised warehouse on land beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police and we are taking the necessary legal action to allow them to move forward as soon as possible .
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to consider when we present our case . "
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise will be transformed from the former Hotel Birkenhof .
The house on the outskirts of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year .
This is good news for the city .
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time , as well as income from the visitor 's tax .
In the autumn of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered to the county council as a collective accommodation , causing controversy .
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at the time .
However , Freudenstadt 's mayor , Julian Osswald , in particular , defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interest in the hotel .
He should be proved right .
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise .
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .
At the former Hotel Birkenhof , rubbish bins have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done .
The floors were torn out , ceilings partially dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .
The entire hotel building is a single construction site .
There is still much to do between now and March .
" It 's actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .
Everything is to be renewed in the style of the Black Forest .
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area will be redesigned , new windows will be installed .
Everything should later become " close to the citizens , " as Thomas Scherer puts it .
" We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it . "
The facilities include a swimming pool , a spa area and a meeting room .
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already on an upscale inner-city level , emphasizes Scherer .
Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set itself up on a broad scale , explains Scherer .
Individual holidaymakers , groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel .
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and director of tourism Michael Krause , according to Scherer .
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group .
" We are on the same line . "
Asked about the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific .
Just under a million euros , he reckons .
The exterior systems are also being put on the front burner , which is already clearly visible .
In a courtyard there will be a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market . "
Russia affair : us special investigator settles grand jury
Special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury in the Russia affair involving U.S. President Donald Trump , according to a report .
The panel began work in recent weeks , the Wall Street Journal wrote , citing people familiar with the matter .
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation .
CNN reported that there are already preliminary subpoenas from the panel related to a meeting between Trump 's eldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump 's campaign and Moscow .
The investigation will focus on several men who served as advisors to the Republican during the campaign .
Mueller also reportedly came under increasing scrutiny for Trump 's private and business environment .
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally put Trump at the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair .
The main task of Grand juries is to examine existing evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to bring charges .
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers .
Most of the time , they are turned on when there are major and controversial cases .
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
The panel may also be called in by the public prosecutor 's office to summon people for interrogation under oath .
Subpoenas have already been issued around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer , according to CNN .
People involved in the meeting were asked to testify , the report said .
They should also provide documents .
In addition to Trump Jr . , Trump 's adviser and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then-campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , were also at the conversation .
Legal experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the inauguration showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary .
However , it did not necessarily mean that the grand jury would be called in at the end to decide whether to bring an indictment .
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump .
Amid the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents .
" The Russia story is a total fabrication , " Trump said .
The issue gives Democrats a way to " feel good because they have nothing else to talk about . "
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , said in an opinion piece that he knew nothing about the establishment of a grand jury .
But they also usually work in secret , he said .
The White House supports any action that " fairly " accelerates the work of the special investigator .
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not investigating the president .
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed , the statement said .
Mueller , however , had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey .
It was because of this expulsion that accusations were made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct justice .
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation .
According to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his associates .
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller .
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate case involving the late President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Department of Justice at the president 's insistence .
However , several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Thursday that would make it difficult for the special investigator to be fired .
Antarctica : giant iceberg drives into Antarctica
In West Antarctica , a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the ice shelf .
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremen on Wednesday .
The colossus , weighing more than a trillion tonnes and measuring 5800 square kilometres , is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt .
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giants recorded by researchers over the past three decades .
He does not pose a danger to people .
The extent to which climate change played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear , according to research .
All in all , however , there has been a series of unusual meltdowns of ice skeletons in the region for around 30 years , the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) writes in a fact sheet .
According to many researchers , this may be related to global warming .
The colossus , which has now been broken off , was previously part of the Larsen C Shelf .
Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .
It thus grows further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
The Larsen C Shelf lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula .
North of this slab , the balance of waxing and breakage was disrupted a few years ago .
According to AWI researcher Daniela Jansen , a complete slab has disintegrated there .
There is much to be said for the fact that the Larsen C-Schelfeis is also in danger , because the front edge has never receded as far as it currently is .
In addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece falls off at a key point .
The melting of chilli and iceberg does not raise the sea level , as they swim on the water , displacing ice as much as it produces after the melting itself .
However , the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
This could possibly raise sea levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica ( Midas ) .
The Larsen C Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica , covering almost 50,000 square kilometres , according to AWI .
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 metres .
It breaks down there on a regular basis .
" Although it 's a natural occurrence and we 're not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sheet is now coming into a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of Britain 's Swansea University .
" This is the longest withdrawal since records began , " he also confirmed .
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen C Shelf will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Luckman , adding : " our models say it will be less stable . "
But this development will take decades .
Although these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , a great many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades .
This long stretch of Antarctica stretches towards South America .
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years , making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising most rapidly .
CDU wants house price on staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU demands to leave the employers " association in order to become more attractive .
Just before the summer break , Kreistag saw through 41 new administrative posts .
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .
Now , 17 apprentices are back on their first day of work .
The apprenticeships at the county are obviously very much in demand .
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year .
However , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
At present , there are still 50 unfilled positions at Mettmann County .
They are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as general administration staff .
In Kreistag , the CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , wants to take the initiative and address the lack of skilled labour in the administration .
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration should " develop a concept for personnel recruitment and development . "
The aim is not only to meet short-term demand for skilled workers , but also to counteract the shortage of applicants with a view to the future , it says .
The overall concept should be oriented to the inside and the outside , should show concrete measures for newcomers and should include a training offensive , demands the CDU , FDP and UWG .
That sounds like a good approach .
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that were not previously known .
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
There is talk of a veritable " competition of public employers . "
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
It is high time to act so that more jobs do not remain unfilled .
However , Klaus-Dieter Völker , leader of the CDU group , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .
He recently caused a rotten surprise in his chalk , when he publicly questioned the cover for personnel costs and stunned the other parties .
Völker wants to see a review of all options that allow people to leave the local employers " association .
" If we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration should aim for a house price with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns in the district , " said Völker .
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than is actually provided for by the tariff regulation for the public service .
Salaries are currently strictly regulated , and increases or more money are only possible if you move to a higher level , based on years of employment .
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
Only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new law on the protection of prostitutes .
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Councillor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue unless they comply with new rules on their operations .
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .
Minni 's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid group " Jugend Rettet " because its crew had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
The charity , which has only been in operation for a year , declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we 're very sorry we can 't operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " the organization said in a statement on social media .
'We can only assess all the allegations currently being made after we 've gathered all the information and can assess the situation . '
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of " Jugend Rettet , " the Iuventa , since October .
Its crew is believed to be taking on dinghies migrants , delivered to them directly by traffickers , and allowing the smugglers to leave so the ships can be used again .
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosecutor 's file , the contents of which were published by Italian media .
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard , which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , not for any other reason .
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must have , in particular , an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities .
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve " significant changes or impediments " to its bailouts .
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .
Minniti meanwhile said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescues had plummeted in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit .
" In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
Climbs and Trials
Nine bikers from Weilerm , the " Berlin outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing .
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome addition .
The first tour took in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .
It was followed by viewpoints , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the forested plains .
In between , there were always longer climbs , for which long trials rewarded .
On the second day , we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .
Once again , there was a vantage point at the lookout point , connected by " floaty " trials and moderate ascents .
On the last two days a lot of vertical metres had to be done .
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open-air inhaler .
Neustadt was also targeted .
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had got to know the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of wrestling with the wind and the weather over the stadium turf ?
The fact is that e-sports has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - including big stars , millions of fans and huge high-stakes tournaments .
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs , which are increasingly involved in this area .
VfL Wolfsburg kicked off in 2015 , followed by FC Schalke 04 and , most recently , VfB Stuttgart , which established an e-sports division in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
" We hope to inspire completely new target groups for the VfB , " says board member Jochen Röttgermann .
He is certain that " a number of clubs will be added to this train . "
Next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London will host the first " interactive Club World Cup , " where gamers from different clubs will compete against each other .
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .
" The real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular , that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
With prominent e-athletes under contract , one could be present online far more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia just once a year .
What exactly is it all about ?
In e-sports , computer games such as " League Of Legends , " " DotA 2 , " " Counterstrike " or the football simulation FIFA are fought on a competitive level .
As in normal sports , leagues have long been established in which the pros compete against each other .
And at the 2022 Asian Games , e-sports are already part of the official program .
But is it a proper sport at all ?
For many , the idea certainly needs getting used to .
Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question for a long time .
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions , which are also found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding , and rapid responsiveness .
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
" The fitter player is a good player . "
However , Froböse also sees problems : " doping is becoming more and more an issue . "
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games , and the structures of classic sports were lacking in the scene .
On the positive side , the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sports .
The players are travelling internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
A study by the Deloitte consultancy and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sports .
In 2016 , 50 million Euros were implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsoring and major tournaments .
In three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga , that is little .
However , e-sports are " not far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " the Deloitte consultants write .
Internationally , many countries have already moved on .
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the U.S. team NRG eSports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting company Unikrn .
There is also a lot going on in Europe .
In a Norwegian school , e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction , says Froböse .
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .
" Compared to Europe , Germany lags behind , " explains VfB board member Röttgermann .
It is no longer enough to indulge in nostalgia and to shed light on the old times .
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market .
" We live in a digitised world , " says Dutt .
" You can 't hold on to the fact that only with football everything stays the way it always was . "
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal of poisonous eggs has now affected almost all federal states .
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany .
Only eggs that have been shown not to contain fipronil are to be added to the shelves .
Michelle Carter convicted over texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended .
Carter was convicted in June of negligently killing Conrad Roy , who took his life on July 13 , 2014 .
Roy 's father told the hearing on Thursday : " my family is inconsolable .
My son was my best friend . "
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness .
Dressed in red trousers and a cream colored blouse , Carter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward-facing eyes as she was sentenced .
" Her actions killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor told the court .
" She ended his life to make her own better .
She took no responsibility , " she said .
" She showed no remorse . "
But Carter 's lawyer said it was a " terrible circumstance that she completely regretted . "
However , Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her " age or maturity , or even her mental illness , had a significant impact on her actions . "
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy 's mother , Lynn Roy , saying that " there is not a day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity , " it says .
Mr Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said she was " haunted " by the realisation that she would never attend her brother 's wedding or be an aunt to his children .
" To no longer have that single person I 've been with every day since I was born is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .
The case appears to set a legal precedent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .
The case attracted national attention after Carter 's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life .
" Hang on , spring from a building , stabbing yourself , I don 't know , there are many ways , " she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote , " you have to do it , Conrad " and " all you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy 's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press .
The case has divided legal opinion .
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British co-worker in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : " Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not jail . "
Joshua Kimmich : learning from the new Mini Lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
FC Bayern is confident of a great season for the Confed-Cup winner - there is no harm in extra motivation .
Something was different on his seat in the cabin , Joshua Kimmich saw it immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
But since , on the second day of the Audi Cup , there was of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to be seen , he kept his hand to the bandage he had been given .
" The coach didn 't announce it , " said the Confed-Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as Bayern captain .
Good , the standings could have been better than in the 0 : 2 against the SSC Napoli .
But Kimmich was also able to interpret the sign of the coach that way .
It was not Arturo Vidal , eight years older , who was chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf , made up of young players , debutants and professionals who had just left on holiday , but he .
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust a lot , who you want to keep in a mood .
So anyone who has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation .
Kimmich confirmed : " this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . "
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flicked across the field as a mini-daredevil .
Right back , that 's his position now , the white bandage on the arm did the rest .
And in this starting formation , Kimmich looked like the one who is best placed to take the helm .
He gave instructions , tried to direct the uncoordinated force .
He had the look for the whole thing , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness ( barely clapped ) ; Renato Sanches with sticking to the achievements of the Asian trip ( even only to a limited extent ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not having a negative impact in their first appearance in the Bavarian jersey .
After all , it worked very well .
Süle ran alongside Kimmich , Rudy in front of the defence , both acting with confidence .
The well-known Napoli Storm often struggled , and Süle also tried to build up the game a few times .
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was " not as we hoped . "
But he also showed a decent performance on debut .
Change of game , change of pace : " I was brought up for this style . "
After the match , one saw how unusual this Bavarian world is for the new entrants .
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven .
Kimmich said goodbye after a few cracking statements in the back of his new teammates .
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " I have already noticed what is going on here .
At Bayern , you just have to win every game . "
After all , he no longer has to teach the new .
Alaba motivates ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria 's most famous footballer announced himself via Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies well .
The Bayern-Legionaire is a kind of club mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is excited about our Ladys .
The Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner 's tweet should be a special motivational splash .
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel .
Company pleased with Rhineland-Palatinate minister : economy praises Wisconsin 's pace
It was often irreconcilable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .
Chambers and companies from the region , in response to T V 's question , talk about a change in economic policy - while at the same time blaming the old minister .
Frank Natus , chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( VTU ) , says : " knowing takes up the wishes of the economy , which has blocked Lemke all . "
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy : the closing of Highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's list of priorities .
Before the end of this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning approval procedure , and the building code will be in place by 2021 .
The West Trier bypass , which is in urgent need of the federal highway plan , also plays a role in the country 's plans .
The aim is to get the line up and running in December 2020 , says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann .
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competitive companies .
As suggested by Wissing , the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been slowing for ten years .
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praises the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .
There will be a bonus of 1000 euros for the Master 's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the Master 's training .
However , the list of domestic tasks for the country remains long .
At the same time , the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , chief executive of the Trier Chamber of Commerce .
Of 56 new engineers Wissing intends to recruit at the state enterprise Mobility , only 29 jobs have been filled so far .
The Chamber of Commerce calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Baldauf , vice-president of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed .
Frank Natus also expects the country to come up with a plan to address the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering .
In 2016 , regional companies rated grid supply only 3.4 in an IHK survey .
They complained about stalled internet connections and terminations .
On the other hand , former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it already cleared the field after four months due to disagreements .
Audi to change 850,000 diesel cars - automakers face backlash
A day before Audi 's announcement , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .
The BMW chairman said the company believed " there are smarter options than driving restrictions , " referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel cars .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .
The cost to car manufacturers of installing systems to neutralise emissions from diesel cars is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen 's mistakes , which include the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but drive back in normal driving conditions .
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been indicted , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
Last month , the former head of Thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States .
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen 's profit .
This is the message of the float on Saturday in the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar .
In order for visitors to the Isar to take part , a raft will pass through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday , you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .
And that 's not a common float , with Isar tourists .
Instead , the building department wants to clear up .
On the raft you can see a large information transparency .
It shows a mountain of rubbish .
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors .
With the motto " true love is ... , " the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection is to be sharpened .
Last summer the raft crossed the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mordillos boys " noses and laughter at the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most-publicized cartoon illustrators , the bulging noses of his characters being his trademark .
Even at 85 , the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film .
His message : laugh , " because there is too much suffering in the world . "
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 , the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
During his first years as an artist , he became a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him .
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , " he once said .
After stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved his breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .
Even in China , Mordillo found plenty of fans .
Time and again , the artist was inspired by cities .
Large , circular Mordillos figures tuck into drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
According to his own account , he is still sitting at the drawing table in the early morning , working almost ten hours a day .
On calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , cuddly toys and watches , his droll figures continue to be widely distributed all over the world .
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
The main character in the film " crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos ' most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandfoot as an opponent .
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is due to hit the cinema screen in 2019 .
" I don 't know exactly what they 're going to say , it 's weird for me , " Mordillo says .
The script is not written by him .
That 's why he relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wordless .
Provence lavender under threat from climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is under threat from climate change .
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and insects transmitted by disease , causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .
Eric Chaisse , an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender .
There is also a small cicadas , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas , and in very dry weather there are a lot of them . "
And the stakes are high .
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers , it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics .
Eric Chaisse said : " instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . "
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil , but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to drought .
This year , the town of Geisa in Rhön , Thuringia , celebrates its 1200-year anniversary .
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
Crooks , guilds , dealers , vagrants or a military camp are to be seen in the city centre on these days .
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organized crime , corrupt officials and incessant drug wars .
But that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
They have been told it is important to change their routines .
Two high-profile journalists discuss what feels safer : taking their children to the office , who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009 , or leaving them at home .
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room : adversaries , neutrals , allies .
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and gut feelings are enough .
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
There is no respite from the violence , and while bodies are piling up across the country , more and more journalists are attending : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 . 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states .
Among the latter is its editor and its inspiration from Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .
" The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence .
His absence is deeply felt , though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , showing his middle finger with the word " Justice , " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building . Two reporters in their thirties , Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat .
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and reporters discuss their shared themes , trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .
Although a special prosecutor was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists , it has initiated only two criminal cases .
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year , the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
At Riodoce , they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa , though they are inconsolable and though the terrain is now even more treacherous .
Without information about the killers , without justice , the security discussion meeting has little use , says Ibarra .
" It 's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .
" As long as we don 't know why , we distrust everyone . "
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan .
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced out of his car and shot 12 times , presumably because of the newspaper 's name - which translates as " twelfth river . "
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Valdez was 50 .
He left behind a wife and two adult children .
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan .
But on the subject of Valdez , there is practically nothing but silence .
Since Guzman 's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country 's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions here struggle to fill the void .
It doesn 't matter that in Sinaloa , one or more people are shot in the street every day , or that the cemetery is full of ornate , two-story mausoleums for drug lords larger than many homes for the living .
Forget for a minute that there is a state of " calm " when only one cartel has control of the coastal state , with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States .
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , broke with the blame for not being able to protect his friend .
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .
First , in February , there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman 's sons .
This publication may have angered the sons , suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that published the same story .
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $ 50 holdings .
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem , " Bojorquez said .
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover .
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she was awarded the prestigious Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America .
That same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug story wherever it led .
He voluntarily admitted he was scared .
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October .
" You have to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy .
I don 't want to be asked , " what did you do in the face of so many deaths ... Why didn 't you say what was going on ? "
The Rioice team misses Valdez , the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
They trusted his routine .
He would always wear his hat .
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar across from the office , and always sit there at the same table .
Now they ask : was his love of routine his ruin ?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
" You don 't like it when you 're dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .
" These things were not allowed , " Bojorquez said .
The result is , even in the best of times , a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .
Trust his own instincts .
If it smells wrong , stay away .
The trouble , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal , is that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... And then the thing happened to Javier . "
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states , home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
The landscape is constantly changing .
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training , cell phones were suddenly not allowed . Days earlier , it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
Outside , two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
They were tasked by the state government with protecting Riodoce 's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan .
Half joking , some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy .
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountains , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor 's hometown .
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the prosecutor 's office .
There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened , so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite of drug traffickers and authorities .
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century .
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile corruption cases .
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the venue , including one in which a son of " el Chapo " Guzman escaped a military raid .
Only a few months earlier , readers would have considered Valdez 's column the best-informed source about the kidnapping .
" Before , we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , nicknamed " el Flaco " because of his slim body stature .
" Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . "
Valdez 's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists , because employees have become something they themselves never would have expected : activists on behalf of the press .
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor 's office the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist .
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed .
A burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing , that it is his .
Across the country , journalists have become more vocal , writing down " SOS Press " on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests .
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington , trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the killing of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they were telling the truth .
She has since asked for it to be reinstated by the government , concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity .
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .
In his latest book , Narco Journalism , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under cover with organized crime .
The media watchdog group " articulo 19 " has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officers in the past year .
" In Mexico , you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut , " Ramirez said .
Obviously , the killings have a deterrent effect .
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : " here I am because of my reports . "
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head .
Some branches have chosen to close , according to the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .
Others continue , as Nuevo Laredo 's El Manana did after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with an editorial on the front page with the headline " what do you want from us ? "
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country .
It 's a painful decision .
It 's hard to find work in exile , and they 're still watching the streets and looking for danger .
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to be the case of photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz .
For those left behind and continuing to work , it 's a daily dance with high-risk choices .
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits the drug trade scares him .
" Mexico is going to hell , and that 's why I became a reporter , " he said .
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office , drinking beer , when all of a sudden their phones started to buzz .
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region .
From the edge of the brothel , they posted the news on Riodoce 's website via mobile phone .
The front page had to be changed the next day .
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were keeping watch to see if they were on standby .
If they were scared at all , they didn 't show it .
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa , the employees of Riodoce followed his footsteps .
" How can you even think of closing , " Bojorquez said , " when on the same day that Javier was assassinated , the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting . "
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying one .
Now , researchers have found that the initial findings of a Canadian miner 's incredible rhino were so well preserved that experts have described it as the " Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . "
It was so well preserved that they could even find that its scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had something of a " troubled past . "
The report in the journal Current Biology described him as " the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world . "
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable "
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
It was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) earthen clump .
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be unveiled .
" If you just blink a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it was asleep , " said lead author Caleb Brown , a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature can be seen .
" It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . "
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with an armor and resembles a walking tank , it was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs .
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies , experts say , suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it .
The astounding preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body .
They discovered the counter shading , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .
Although the countershading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment of confrontation as a means of survival .
But most contemporary animals that use the countershading - think deer , zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was facing a real struggle for survival .
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been , " brown said .
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur 's skin was reddish-brown .
Scientists are continuing to examine the animal for clues about its life , including its preserved intestine , to find out what it ate as its last meal .
They believe the dinosaur , when it died , got into a river and was driven out to sea , where it sank on its back to the seabed .
At the time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
" This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin , but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , " brown said .
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period .
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it . If you just look a little with your eyes , you might almost think he 's asleep . "
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs , passed through the Earth .
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors .
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38-foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six-ton monster .
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in mud .
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while he was digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
According to the museum , it is the world 's best-preserved armored dinosaur , including skin and armour , and is complete from snout to hip .
The creatures averaged about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed as much as 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
It contained two 20-inch long tops that protruded from his shoulders .
The researchers believe the armored herbivore swam through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
But the dinosaur 's underwater burial preserved its armour in exquisite detail .
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hollowed-out armoured plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as " rare as winning a lottery .
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .
Fossilized remnants of the skin still cover the hollowed-out tank tops that carry the animal 's skull .
His right front foot is at his side , his five fingers are pushed up .
I can count the scales on his sole . "
In the storm : mass carambolage on A8 : many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car accident .
There are numerous casualties , miles of traffic jams - and gaffers .
Around 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway ( A8 ) late on Thursday afternoon .
According to initial information from the police , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably also trucks , collided between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a thunderstorm around 5 p.m.
The exact number of casualties was not yet known .
They were minor to minor injuries , a police spokesman said .
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene .
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
In the direction of travel in Munich , a backlog of around ten kilometres was formed .
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstructions on the opposite carriageway - caused by numerous gaffers .
The fire brigade took note of the number plates of the vehicle drivers , who now face severe penalties .
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .
This resulted in a collision between a car transporter and a car .
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests " comfort check-in "
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : not suspecting you are sitting in the train and sleeping .
Or you are immersed in your work and just have a brilliant thought .
And then : pufff .
If the conductor comes and wakes you up softly or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow .
Ticket control .
But the interruptions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the ticket control system .
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and are devaluing the ticket .
Currently , a test run is underway on two routes .
" If the offer arrives , we will extend it .
It will then be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a railway spokesman .
" Comfort check-in " is the name given by the train to the discounting of tickets without conductors .
In order to be able to use them , however , a number of requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .
And you have to book an online ticket - which most passengers already do .
You also have to buy it via the Deutsche Bahn app , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .
And last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
Because the " comfort check-in " works like this : you get on the train , call up your ticket under " my tickets . "
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation .
Train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at the ticket control at Place Y , he will know that there is a passenger sitting there with an already validated online ticket .
So you can continue to sleep , keep working , keep quiet .
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers .
" If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants , simply check in the DB Navigator yourself .
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train , " says Michael Peterson , marketing director of DB Fernverkehr .
Second plus : " and our employees have more time than they do today to respond to individual customer needs . "
Those who often travel by train know that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances .
Because you often have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need for the devaluation of online tickets .
Either there is no credit card or identity card , or there is no other document to show .
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in checking one 's ticket , and ultimately deprives the conductor of time to deal with other concerns .
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
And only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been released .
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " whose Streets ? "
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core .
Just a day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school .
" The police have just killed a 18-year-old child and it is still lying on the street , " it said .
Bewildered , as no one else had posted the information on her feed , she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter .
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline .
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson , Mo .
He posted a picture of Brown 's lifeless body strewn out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
" That 's wild , " Ferrell thought to himself .
But death was nothing new for her and her community .
She dropped her cell phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening .
There were photos of the police tape and people shouting , and of a man claiming to be Brown 's father who carried a sign saying , " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog .
In another video , she said , another policeman unsecured his rifle and shouted , " I 'm going to kill you ... Animals all . "
" It 's not common , " Ferrell recalled her saying .
'That 's not the kind of murder we 've got used to and can call typical . '
In that moment , I felt shaking .
I was angry and crying . "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .
After landing at 11pm , she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning .
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary , " whose Streets ? , " in cinemas from the age of 11 .
It 's a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience , from the point of view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who was wearing a floral dress and a matching crown , the two discussed a conversation they had " about the black experience and the black state " countless times before this morning .
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " She recalled what she said .
" We 're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it wasn 't right .
I couldn 't take them , " Ferrell said later .
" What happened today is a culmination of ... What happened in the past .
She needs to know it and see it and be brought up in it .
It must be well developed , know not only activism and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .
Even though I 'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn 't personally experience blatant racism , she 's no different from the next black woman 's child .
I feel like I 'm doing her a disservice to keep her away . '
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road , a location opposite the police station that became a camp area as activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .
There , Ferrell and her daughter bonded with a local business owner who was making lunch .
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters .
Slowly , a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said , noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .
" I had no experience in organizing .
It 's all come . '
Weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan , one of the film 's co-directors .
Folayan said she and her cameraman , Lucas Alvarado-Farrar , just wanted to " document " what happened .
One question came to Ferrell 's mind : " do you want to document or do you try to find a story you can exploit ? "
That skepticism was fueled by myriad cases of people , often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .
As Folayan explained in a recent interview , " we had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn 't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . "
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates .
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , the team from " whose Streets ? " Followed in the years after Brown 's shooting .
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us ... We 're talking , " Davis said .
" That was the main thing for me , how these people are portrayed , because that 's how I 'm going to be portrayed . "
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement was " not a messiah leader , but a community coming together , " Folayan said - she proved to be the film 's most open participant .
As a result , documents from " whose Streets ? " Reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .
" I felt like I was naked , " Ferrell said , laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time .
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . "
In addition , Ferrell 's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement .
Two of the three founders of the movement , who coined the film " BlacklivesMatter " on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin , identify themselves as gay .
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , " Ferrell said , " and so we 're constantly fighting on different fronts .
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . "
Folayan agreed , noting that " the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women . "
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action , " where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .
" She was the person who stirred up that energy , " she said .
" It 's not a coincidence , although she 's been on the front line , because with a life at these crosshairs as a black , gay woman , there 's so much at stake .
You can feel their energy through the screen . "
By now , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist .
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration .
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : " a mess . "
Still , she 's clinging to a chant and she 's been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago .
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .
It is our duty to win .
We must love and support each other .
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . "
From " dream " to " megalomania " : TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery
The Bit-Gallery moves people , although it is far from being built .
But since the first presentation in 2009 , the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents .
The topic hardly leaves you cold .
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg . "
While some say to the Bit-Gallery : " that would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " that would be really great " ( Nicole Schausten ) , from the other side comes : " need no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or simply : " megalomania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .
While supporters are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed .
In addition , the gallery is planned on the very site where the Bauernmarkthalle stands , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .
The construction work will come to an end .
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to go to Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : " we have been shopping almost weekly in the Bauernmarkthalle for many years .
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the landlady are always very happy .
We also discovered the butcher 's shop for ourselves .
We hope that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery , there will be a chance to maintain this offer .
In other cities , this is also the case .
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . "
Gerd Densing : " whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
However , this will probably not be very low for the new project . "
Eva Kilic : " what shopping malls in Bitburg ?
Whether it 's clothing , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets , I find that superfluous .
There is already enough of that in our city .
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
However , since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall .
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , for the most part offered directly by the producer and , on top of that , are inexpensive .
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not acceptable to a retailer .
What a pity , there are almost no special shops left , and what is left of them will probably disappear . "
Wolf Fandel : " a shopping mall with a market hall doesn 't fit together for me .
And the gallery doesn 't fit Bitburg .
Above all : where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period ?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the Bit-Gallery actually comes at some point .
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie manage to drive all business out of Bitburg before ? "
George Marquet : " it just won 't work .
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer 's market instead of this gallery .
But there is no room for a farmer 's market hall , thanks to the insane number of - in my opinion - meaningless building projects in Bitburg .
If the farmer 's market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . "
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning 's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York , there are many faces - white , black and brown , almost imperceptibly alike - hanging from cables from the ceiling .
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek tubers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after she made public classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks website .
The new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is called A Becoming Resemblance .
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and the arts , and Manning , a transwoman and trailblazing dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he only had three days left in office .
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp , if somewhat intellectual , commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning , from which 30 portraits were created of how someone might look with these genomic data .
Manning , who was born Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty , was convicted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the espionage law , computer fraud and theft .
Through prison , her image was suppressed , so much so that there was only one photograph - a grainy , black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver 's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came off the big success of her 2012 project " Stranger Visions . "
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum , extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like .
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
" They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .
And she couldn 't visit at the time and she couldn 't be photographed , so you got in touch with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait .
The artist and her jailed muse became unequal nephews who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
They even created a comic " suppressed Images , " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which the president would commute Chelsea 's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .
That Obama would actually demand Manning 's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
There is something deep and strong now , too , in the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump waging a war against government whistle-blowers and transgender troops to find new , tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to address .
When asked about the strange timing of all these things , Dewey-Hagborg said that " things happen for a certain reason . "
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with her oversized signature underneath ( the " I " in her surname is emblazoned with a heart ) , called for an end to " automatic fragmentation based on gender , race , sexuality and culture . "
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfoot of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show , by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the artist 's sophisticated scientific lexicon ) , how strikingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
" What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn 't care who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose 2007 video work , Spurious Memories , can also be seen .
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that 's 30 of those stories . "
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above comic novella .
She shows Manning as she emerges from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong with a hands-free phone in her hand .
" If they shut down your speech , they won , " it read .
" So never shut your mouth . "
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist , who greets from Philadelphia .
" I still get goosebumps when I talk about it . "
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do so , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by her own genomic simulacrum , gathering together like hordes of protesters .
This was also targeted , as was everything in the exhibition , down to size ( 5 " 2 , Manning 's stature ) , where her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .
" In the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits .
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment .
Arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , Cook County District Court records show .
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , passed away after multiple stitches .
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27 .
Officers received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body .
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene , and detectives are investigating the stabbings as murder , while police are actively searching for the two suspects , officials said .
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cubbage , the vice president for university relations , said in an emailed statement that Lathem was now on leave and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus .
" This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation , " Cubbage said .
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University .
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that " we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to assist the U.S. investigation authorities in any way we can . "
The statement added that Warren 's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand down .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urges the suspects to stand up to the authorities .
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them are intensifying , " Guglielmi said .
Guglielmi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip that said something had happened in Apartment 1008 .
Police described the scene as very gruesome .
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27 .
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .
Grand Plaza 's management team released a statement to residents : " police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) are implemented .
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard , " Mutko said on Thursday .
The PM commented on the second part of WADA 's road map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation 's website .
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .
In relation to the matter , Mutko said : " we are carrying out the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .
All measures have been implemented .
But there were no government programs , and we won 't admit something that doesn 't exist . "
Mutko 's words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of Russia 's independent anti-doping commission .
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day , Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : " we have said repeatedly that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally , " Smirnov added .
Rusada was banned from carrying out doping checks in Russia by WADA in November 2015 amid the doping scandal .
However , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .
After a visit to the organization 's headquarters in Moscow in July , WADA director general Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was " moving in the right direction " to be reinstated .
Aldi is not selling eggs for the time being
This was announced by the business groups .
It was a mere precaution that no adverse health effects could be expected , the statement said .
From now on , only eggs that have been tested negative for fipronilous anti-lice agents are expected to be delivered to Aldi .
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers .
The start-ups that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees " happiness with your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys didn 't work .
Answers were often vague , unhelpful or - worse - fraudulent .
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .
" There was just never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .
She called people from outside for help .
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and approach the board directly .
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where 's the Fitbit for your business ? " Said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel during the three years with Glint .
In addition to the Snap-polls and surveys by certain teams , it offers a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval ratings - so you can drill down on why .
Companies come to realise that you have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don 't become the next Uber to be engulfed in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished .
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .
The global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to financial engineering website Let 's Talk Payments .
Denver , Colorado , start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepute .
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .
Uber recently signed up as a client .
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailored " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time , and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that lets employees report bad behavior .
And when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .
" The court of public opinion has caught up with the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and chief executive of Convercent .
If a company is found to be treating its employees badly or behaving unethically , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts , employee turnover and lawsuits , Quinlan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
Earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company 's headquarters , file a formal complaint and hope it was taken seriously .
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays general counsel , who said there was no good way to track employees " complaints .
Now that the company is using Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
" I can get closer to that holistic , 360-degree view into the experience of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads Ruby Tuesday 's Risk Management Group .
" And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation . "
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethics violations caused by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realised you couldn 't stop their dirty laundry going online .
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for using their products .
It is a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors , who have supported both start-ups .
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , bringing the total capital to $ 47 million .
Glitter secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners , bringing its total financing to $ 60 million .
These investments hardly come as a surprise , given the networked nature of business , culture and venture capital .
There is a growing body of research showing that today 's employees expect more from their jobs than before .
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes .
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission .
" If people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies are doing well , and companies are doing well when employees are engaged and engaged .
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and deployment , it 's no wonder you 'll find support .
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
But the data is useless if a company 's managers do not take action .
In fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , they may have an expectation that change is on the way .
And if change doesn 't come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , " said Russell Raath , president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International , which has seen companies that have relied too heavily on data collection .
" Because if you don 't follow employees will ask themselves , " have you really heard me ?
Do you care ?
And if you don 't care , why should I ? "
Madison Reed , who now conducts monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , according to Errett .
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees , thanks to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communications training session to address the issues .
At Ruby Tuesday , the company keeps getting new insights about employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to better retention of workers in an industry known for high turnover .
" If you 're not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you 're going to lose people , " Vitrano said .
" And if you lose people , you lose customers , too .
And if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It comes to 11 p.m. , when a crowd of UCLA football players chatted on one side of the team 's new practice fields on campus .
Some pulled out their jersey tops and showed their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp .
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
Players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice session before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6 : 30 a.m. the next morning .
" This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , " Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
The NCAA eliminated two-day practice sessions to ease the burden on players , and it actually extended its days - at least until Friday 's final .
That 's why UCLA 's first three workouts should begin at 7 : 15 p.m. to match the players " already packed schedules .
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and practiced practice during summer school for the first time during Mora 's six seasons at Westwood .
They are scheduled to hold 18 practice sessions over the course of August , 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A & M in September .
Mora said he supports the NCAA 's rule change , even if it adds another point to players " busy routes .
" We put this huge burden three or four days on it , and it 's very challenging , " mora said .
" And they just pushed it through , they keep placating , they 're great people .
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it 'll be really great . '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which won 't be an easy task given the clear lines of vision of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center , an upper-class hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goal post .
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend , but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms are vacant during the season .
" We will use our security , " mora said .
" That 's a real problem , and it 's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then preparing to record an exercise .
If you have the videotape of an exercise , it 's a pretty good deal .
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking lot 8 .
We will do the best with what we have .
I am not too worried about that .
We 've got a plan . '
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original ad , the world 's largest online social network said on Thursday . It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fact news .
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible misreporting and send it to fact-checkers , who may display fact-checking results from the original article .
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main points of distribution for so-called fake news , which many believe also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May 's presidential election , and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections there .
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
" In addition to recognizing which stories are being challenged by fact-checking third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " Sara Su , product manager for Facebook News , said in a blog .
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news .
Creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
In its recent past , the little Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents .
" I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says wistfully .
" What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . "
" A Castle in England " covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney . Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz , Briony May Smith , William Exley , Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg .
It 's not Rhodes " first book based on an archive : he wrote " Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories " in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .
" I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .
" That 's his thumb print !
And letters always smelled of smoke , because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light .
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there himself .
Oh , I love archives ! "
For someone so smitten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " to be honest : I overrated my welcome a little " ) , this all seems too nice to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , browsing the archives and studying the castle 's many treasures and curiosities , such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries digging .
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers , gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
Then , at night , he drank " whiskey and started writing . "
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heiress , Elizabeth Hussey , died .
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just started looking after the archive , which he described as " hundreds of years of aristocrats saying " Oh , throw it in the attic . " "
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps showing who owned what : " you might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch around which two families fought .
Guys , let it all go ! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve more broadly into English history , including " The Labourer , " which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381 .
" There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380 , in this book called " Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex , " " says Rhodes .
" The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
Maybe the two are connected ? "
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle 's history - such as " The Priest , " which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
Or " The Smuggler , " depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .
The Darrells are Rhodes " favourite family of Scotney : " the gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks , repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn 't afford .
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys , with a talent for recruiting heirs . "
After the end of his assignment at the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He completed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki , the site of an early-20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature .
But Scotney has a special place for him .
" I was sad to go again , " he says .
It was like , " ah , now I have to deal with the damn life again . "
Campaign launched : over 300-year-old St. Mary 's Chapel in Rhöndorf shrouded
With the veiling of the 301 year old St. Mary 's Chapel in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched on Friday its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( Thursday 's Rundschau ) .
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
At the end of August , as the highlight of the campaign , there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth .
" Too nice for us .
Or ? " The makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .
" We don 't really think so ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website , which was opened yesterday .
" But we are using this measure to gain your attention .
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem .
Basically , we firmly believe that as citizens of Bad Honnefer , we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . "
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it said .
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition . "
After all , it is in competition with other municipalities .
The city of Bad Honnef will cost a mid-five-figure sum for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps .
So did this week .
At first glance , this is a normal process .
But nothing is routine among Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as it used to be , but in the Prime Minister 's Office .
The five vice-presidents , as well as the ministers of defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs , have now also participated in the discussions , under the chairmanship of the head of government .
As a result , the civilians in the YAS were in the majority .
The government takes the reins in the military .
Chief of the General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the air force and the navy have been removed .
Since the failed coup , head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen , whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind behind the coup attempt .
Negotiations have been taking place in Ankara since this week against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt .
Already the day after the coup , Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a " gift from God " because he gave him the opportunity to " completely clean up " the armed forces .
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army ?
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " discomfort in Military Headquarters . "
In the General Staff , there are concerns about the increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifests itself , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on the wearing of headscarves for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
In any case , the army and the security forces continue to play a major role .
In mid-July , Erdogan ordered the firing of a further 7395 public servants , including 2303 police and 546 soldiers .
At the same time , it seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military .
The generals used to be considered the real masters of the country .
Three times they coughed , citing their role as guardians of the secular state order .
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military , not least by invoking the reform requirements of the European Union .
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing ahead with the Islamisation of the armed forces .
In the magazine " vocal Europe , " an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and Salafists " within a few years .
If that is the case , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
In any case , after the purges , there are doubts in the alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army .
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened , " NATO diplomats say .
Washington changes green card rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .
He plans to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , tougher rules on obtaining temporary work permits and restrictions on family-based visas .
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president .
The bill is to be debated in the two chambers of Congress .
" This bill will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way in which green cards are issued to citizens from other countries . "
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " Trump said , quoted by American media .
Ministry to refurbish track for racecourse shuttle
The future of the Rennsteigshuttles has been debated again and again over the past few months - now it should be done very quickly .
Before the end of the year , work is to be done on the ramshackle stretch on which the tourist train runs .
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteigshuttle in the long term , construction work on the track is to begin before the end of this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
" With the decision to continue to order and refurbish the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route , the country is committed to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism , " said State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday .
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at around 2.5 million euros .
Of this sum , the country takes over 75 percent .
The contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being finalized , explained Sühl .
The ministry and Südthüringen Bahn , as the operator , are already agreed on the technical details .
" With this , the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " Sühl said .
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .
This means that the Rennsteig-Shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017 .
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway line between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig , which is particularly popular with tourists .
In recent months , during the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the line is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future .
The route is also severely dilapidated in parts .
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn 't be even more crazy in 2017 , comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
Yes , indeed .
Sex robots are a big deal right now .
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
According to Noel Sharkey , emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we need to start taking their rise seriously .
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail .
" People are making fun of them , but companies are delivering a lot of it , and we 're going to see them a lot more often , " Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report .
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence .
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his beliefs , choosing everything from the robot 's eye color , the shape of the nipples , to the type or color of his fingernails .
But it becomes even more troubling , as many robots possess the " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
The RealBox robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing , such as shyness .
And then there 's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot , developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed personalities such as " frigid Farrah , " which gives the impression of shyness and " wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well suited to your personality as possible , " enthuses True Companion 's website .
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people !
She can be tired , fixated on conversation , or she can be " in a mood ! "
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female traits , the allusions to rape when one takes a step toward Frigid ( read : reluctant ) Farrah , worry one the most .
On its website , True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator , but for men .
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can 't men have a Roxxxy ? " The website states .
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture , a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
Most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes its rising popularity , they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being .
But what seeps out of the fringe can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .
Surely there is some overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women 's rights are under threat around the world , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women .
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series " The Handmaid 's Tale " ( " The Report of the Magd " ) is not the graphic images , the entangled bodies and the pierced eyes , but how realistic this vision is .
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with porn proportions ) .
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .
But , to the point , when it comes to their " personalities , " the robots do not represent real women .
They can 't disconnect from their companion or just walk away .
They have no mediation or background story , nothing to suggest independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total submission .
In other words , they are happy slaves .
Or to paraphrase 2017 : maids
Trump 's big achievement ?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polled the U.S. electorate have also divided small-sized families .
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving , there were newspapers in the U.S. offering advice on how to deal with the horror of relatives voting for Trump .
We are all supposed to make an effort to burst our filter bubbles .
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together .
I mention this because my cousin , a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long dealt with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
With Trump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the republican kinship she fought with for decades over politics , is suddenly and strangely on the same page .
Around the dinner table , that 's certainly a good thing , but it strikes me in a wider context that it also carries significant risks .
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we are referring to the scary possibility that one day his kittens will not repel us .
There is , however , an even more terrifying long-term scenario , in which Trump " normalizes " right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness by comparison with his standards .
I now find myself haunted by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax return looked like ) - both of which , compared to Trump , actually appear to be very mild offenses .
If Trump goes , the next Republican nominee only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .
When my cousin was in town , we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the carousels of New York 's parking department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need caffeine .
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the climactic music conveys this in a strange way .
So many clichés disappoint a city : the views of tall buildings are getting old , the skylines are becoming too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not living up to the dream .
Thirty-five years later , and I 'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in north London .
The Central Park carousel , however , is still a strangely magical experience , as here two two-year-olds , a 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go on it and all have a great time .
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given it the full score , but luckily no one asked for it .
On the other hand , in a department store this week , I was forced to rate my " experience " of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street , it 's the same , plus the option to match the rating with a 15 percent tip - this to buy something over the counter .
Not only does this slow down what should be a neutral exchange , but it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
The poor woman in the department store stood excitedly grinning , while I tired of the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius has left prison for a second time for a hospital visit .
Last year , he was taken to hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrist , which he reportedly suffered after a fall in his cell , according to prison authorities .
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first-degree manslaughter conviction .
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine 's Day 2013 by shooting at her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria .
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a late-night intruder who hid in the cabin .
Prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal Pistorius ' six-year jail term , which they say is too lenient .
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pistorius is at risk of having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .
There is no death penalty in South Africa .
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools , fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released on holiday and into secondary schools .
Three of the students will go to secondary school , four to secondary school .
The head of the school , Angelika Sitte , welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .
The 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle as a symbol for the dismissal of the school , which grows up in the chicken farm but is then released into freedom .
The cheerful crowd performed a musical called " der Adler im Höhnerhof . "
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens .
Instead of a chicken coop , a small eagle came out .
But the hope of making him a chicken was dashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and vanished .
After that , classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank 's enrollment .
The hens danced with the young goggles , who were carrying cylinders , to make the bet .
The eagle stands for integration , said head teacher Angelika Sitte .
The kitten is different from the other kittens , but it belongs to them .
But he will never be like a chicken .
His purpose , he said , was to be free .
She wanted every fourth-grader to feel accepted in their new school .
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues , the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps into classroom bottlenecks , and the parents " representatives .
The kissing season is now over , explained classroom teacher Sophia Schumacher .
She was reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .
In the end , she was able to rely on fourth-graders .
At the end , all the students sang a song of summer time and holiday time .
There was great joy among the children .
Eight first-graders have already signed up for the new school year .
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced , quoted by television .
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally camping people , including the two Bulgarians , were arrested by the police in Sithonia .
They were released on the same day while an investigation is ongoing .
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released .
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to be staying in a place not intended for that purpose .
Checks will continue throughout the season .
The ministry said the court may impose a fine .
Software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place ?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
The most important questions and answers at a glance .
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
The aim is to improve the emission performance of Euro 5 and Euro 6 cars .
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives the assessment :
Is the new action mandatory ?
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
" The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software , " says Anja Smetanin .
The German Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) has ordered their retrofitting .
How and when will customers be informed of updates ?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months , but have not yet given a precise date .
Daimler has announced that it will write to anyone affected .
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within the scope of the inspection .
How long are the conversions likely to take overall ?
" Hard to say , " says Smetanin .
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure .
" Because we have seen that the car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . "
How long should the update take ?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment .
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?
The ACE advises waiting .
Foreign manufacturers are likely to follow suit , Smetanin said .
Is there now a risk of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars ?
The ACE fears this .
But it is precisely in the regions where there is a risk of driving bans .
In rural areas , there has so far been no loss of value for older diesels .
The ACE advises waiting with a sale .
Ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest .
Ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year 's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
Traditionally , U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony along with his wife Melania .
For this reason , the award winner Lear , who has been announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the gala .
He told The New York Times : " this presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even depriving them of resources - and that puts a strain on me . "
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view .
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
Previous winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker , Haslach 's master builder , will retire next year .
The position has already been advertised - however , suitable candidates are rare .
WACKER has been a town builder for 31 years .
And the work is still great fun for him , as he conveys in the press interview .
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor .
At the same time , he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile .
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible .
So - taking into account the regular notice periods - there should still be enough time for familiarisation .
Since Haslach serves as the lower building rights authority for the administrative community , the applicant must present appropriate qualifications .
The city definitely wants to keep this function .
If they could no longer fill them in , citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for counselling .
But closeness to the citizens is important to the city and to itself , says Wacker , who reports on a good working atmosphere as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens .
In more than 30 years in office , several important projects have accumulated , which Wacker looks back on with pride .
" We are making the city worth living , " he is sure of the building office and its employees .
But also in the future , varied projects will be on the agenda : the remodelling of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , have been initiated .
The Kinzigbrücke bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated , and the renovation of the stadium is still an issue .
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , " if we get it right , " estimates Wacker .
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .
The work here is fun . "
In terms of design , there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre for a city builder .
Haslach 's own farm and nursery can be quite flexible in responding to many things .
" You can move a lot , " said Wacker , and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors .
As the old town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to " keep an eye on what fits in " when new buildings are approved , emphasizes the outgoing city builder .
In any case , the city builder bears a high degree of responsibility .
He is a builder , " in the end , everything here runs over my table . "
He can count on many years of support and coordination : Markus Neumaier ( civil engineering ) has been with us for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
Also , Wacker wants his successor to stay for a long time : " we are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay . "
After all , continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
Anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should , according to information provided by the City of Haslach , have completed studies as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of building regulations and planning law .
The City Construction Office is responsible for building and civil engineering , building management , land acquisition , management of urban properties , municipal depot with a building yard and municipal nursery , as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection .
Bicycle thrown on wires : southbound carriageway blocked
According to police , the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Strasse ( B116 ) onto the lines .
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
The investigators are looking for two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours .
A rose-tinted scooter and a bicycle driver were spotted near the scene of the crime by witnesses .
" This goes far beyond a robbery spree , " ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA .
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and also put the train traffic at risk .
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of replacement rail transport , the perpetrators could also be penalised by railway customers .
In total , a " substantial " sum is expected , the spokesman said .
The damage had been repaired again on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the Southern Railway line could be managed without any obstructions .
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning , two of them related to long-distance transport .
Freight trains were not cancelled , but they were delayed .
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch , around 200 metres of overhead cables had to be replaced .
Insulators and poles were also damaged .
Red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease )
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system .
But a new study claims just the opposite : a diet rich in button-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease .
The incurable condition , which affects around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK , causes stomach cramps and flatulence , recurrent or bloody diarrhoea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
While sufferers are usually advised to shun meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .
The lead researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
If the balance tilts too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bowel disease .
Experiments found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines .
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the cells " appearance .
Professor Colonna said : " we have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieus , when the same system also affects humans .
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , housed separately , did not .
They suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but were absent in the mice without them .
Mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed .
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells .
When the active component was purified from the liquid , it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid .
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tryptophan levels were halved , the number of cells dropped by half .
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts .
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease .
She said : " the development of these cells is probably something we would like to encourage , as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestines .
Potentially , high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United , a " genius " has signed with Nemanja Matic , believes Jose Mourinho , after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night .
The £ 40m signing from Chelsea began with a 2-1 win in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the halter-side role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched ahead at will .
However , Matic had been ruled out of the Blues " pre-season tour of Asia and managed just 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the Premier League season began .
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " Mourinho said .
" We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later . "
Alongside Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season .
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments .
" To get three out of four , I thank the club for that , " he added .
'i 'll be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they 've put in a lot of effort . '
Boeing " paints " Dreamliner in the sky
Us aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved across the U.S. in the form of a Dreamliner , which is several thousand kilometers .
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner .
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously done such advertising .
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
How the wind turns : when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain amount of concern before elections .
Just no storm-fire from the party headquarters , just no headwind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners .
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
Since then , the employees of Willy-Brandt-Haus have watched the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror .
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in terms of headwinds .
It was low-pitched .
One by one .
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .
" This shows once again that red-green simply cannot govern reliably , " CDU general secretary Peter Tauber told the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .
The surprise resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
Five months before the general election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and FDP .
Greens leader Michael Kellner has called on the reclusive Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate .
The transition to the CDU is a clear distortion of the voter 's will .
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Green Party told the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .
" All this must not be true , " sighs one SPD election fighter as the new hideous message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is without his own government majority after the Green MP Elke Twesten has joined the CDU .
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of crises , big and small , in SPD national associations .
And no one knows what comes next .
The malaise began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
A blue eye , nothing more , the comrades at the time calmed down .
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .
It became so - and it all got much worse .
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tug of war , the Düsseldorf-Pleite ruined the party .
The comrades struggled to get back on their feet in the weeks that followed .
Then , when they had just taken new courage , came the G-20 summit in Hamburg .
And with him came the next low blow .
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong leader of the SPD , lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his town was burning .
And because , in crisis communication , he did pretty much everything wrong afterwards that can be done wrong .
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .
Now Stephan Weil .
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been under criticism for some time because of the VW gas affair and his role on the supervisory board .
Meagre poll numbers were added .
In spite of this , or perhaps because of it , Weil has been trying harder and harder over the past few weeks to set accents in the federal government .
Even comrades around Martin Schulz did not hide the former mayor of Hanover 's desire to expand his power in Berlin .
They let him go , because they promised Weil to stabilize the party .
Now , the exact opposite may happen .
At the same time , Weil is basically not to blame for the partisan squabbling of the Lower Saxony Greens .
And Schulz certainly did not .
For the time being , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
Her anger is directed at the Greens , and here especially at the renegade parliamentarian Tvwest .
" It is unbearable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Tvist puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) .
Mrs Tvist was elected to parliament not because she was a direct candidate , but through the Land list of the Lower Saxony Greens , the Lower Saxony MP added .
The logical consequence would be for her to relinquish her mandate .
Thomas Oppermann , leader of the SPD parliamentary group , deplores a " undemocratic manoeuvre . "
" The voter 's will four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil prime minister , " Oppermann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election , told the RND .
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member is distorting the election result , " Oppermann said .
He called for the background to be clarified .
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments by the CDU of Lower Saxony .
Subsidies for the town centre III
Those who want to renovate their old house will soon be able to get support from the country .
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Sengen .
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far .
Since 1991 , there have been redevelopment areas in Sengen .
At the time , in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding .
In the restoration area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsidy was still 60 percent .
For Schindler , the renovations to date are a " success project " - after all , it is important to promote interior development as well , and not just to open up new construction areas .
On 4 April , the Regional Council of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III .
The total funding amounts to 833 333 euros , of which 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the municipality of Sengen .
How will a redevelopment area be created ?
According to Schindler , they will investigate where the " really old " houses are .
However , it is also important to determine whether there is any interest in renovating the planned area .
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could then also shift again .
On Wednesday evening , STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .
Keller presented the contents of the federal and state programme " social Town , " within which the redevelopment would then be carried out .
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis , i.e. per plot of land .
The redevelopment area would then be established as a statute .
The funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
However , the inventory would be carried out before September of this year , during which those involved in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill in .
If possible , the articles of association are to be approved in November or December , so that the renovation work can begin next year .
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations in question .
It is a matter of assessing the urban grievances and deciding when to renovate and to what extent .
A renovation note will then be entered in the land register for the property in question .
Pietzschmann will come back to his senses and get an idea of the situation , she promised .
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
For this reason , there will be questionnaires which will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and which can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays .
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land arc , " which deals , among other things , with the structural condition and the plans for renovation .
In the grey questionnaire , the " budget and housing questionnaire , " information can be given on the size , distribution and inhabitants of a residential area .
The blue " operating bow " is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building .
However , it should be noted , Gotzel pointed out , that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time .
In addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding is based on the " first come , first served " principle .
You can 't " reserve " subsidies for later .
Finally , photos of the project " Stadtkern II " were shown , in order to make a renovation " palatable " to those present .
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a handshake .
Steven Northam , 33 , had the tiny chip implanted between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals looking to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson , a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to medical standard .
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes just 30 seconds .
Mr Northam 's firm also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip , all for a £ 300 surcharge per castle .
The married father of one has now fitted technology both at home and in his BMW Z4 , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
White House advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House 's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month is costing taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military , which was left to TIME magazine .
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House featuring American construction programs .
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states .
The helicopter , manufactured in Connecticut , was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine , a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi .
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a piecemeal order , or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to records from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the HMX-1 commander wrote to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation , on the eve of the event .
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at around 7am on July 17 for the event at 3pm , and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening .
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of hours of service .
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event , while the unit 's security personnel remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
Records provided to TIME did not clarify whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event might violate the provision .
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that it was not , " the commander wrote .
" Sounds like you 're locked up , " the deputy commander replied .
The " made in America " event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
But official events also have political overtones .
At the event , the president gave a push to reform health care reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he touted efforts to curb government regulations .
The use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are required to use them for travel .
But requesting their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor 's use of the presidential plane .
" The White House is excited by the " made In America " show - which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials , " said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters .
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn to drop the U.S. president off at the White House with precise centimetres .
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House .
The flight for the " made in America " event counted in the flight crew 's training needs for the month , an official said .
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for " non-presidential support missions . "
The White House said taxpayers were not taking on the burden for any of the other props presented at the event .
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
However , according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year , the VH-3D DoD reimbursement rate is $ 24,380 per hour of flight .
Records of the unit record the plane 's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility at Quantico in Virginia .
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .
" Setting the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading , " Walters said .
" These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "
According to a 2015 RAND study , DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account fuel , maintenance and contract costs .
At the time , former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter 's use for the event .
" The idea is to present this week things that are made in America , " Spicer said .
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .
And I think like most Americans , we 're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for .
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . "
It was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he sat in the driver 's seat of a firefighter 's car .
At the White House , Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the president said , " I have three of them . "
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
The top runner of the Second National Tennis League will compete in the Suchsdorfer SV table tennis tournament .
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 am in Kiel at the Suchsdorfer SV table tennis tournament .
Despite a record that is still impeccable after five matches , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality .
Team principal Marius Zay certainly has respect for the opponent .
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
Especially on the back positions , I think the team is very good . "
Imports from the far north are the main source of class and stability for Suchsdorfer SV .
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup .
And they are also strong in doubles , " says Zay , looking at Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all of Denmark ) .
" As always , this will be difficult for us .
You need a good dose of luck . "
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north stands practically .
His debut for blue-and-white could give Maxime Janvier .
If the Frenchman , who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella in Italy , does not make it to the Bundesliga match , Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , who is playing in the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic , will make his first bet this season .
The so far undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarussian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster , Máté Valkusz could also return to the team .
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian , who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016 , someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill up the squad .
How America can hurt OMV
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
" In its haste to enact the law , " Congress has packed in a few " unconstitutional provisions , " he acknowledged .
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected , and even Brussels scoffed at the U.S. move .
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .
Since then , investors of the domestic OMV , which , together with other European companies , is financing the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline Nord Stream 2 , have been correspondingly worried .
The threat level is huge .
However , it is too early to estimate the consequences , said the oil company 's official statement .
In fact , Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
He has twelve weapons to choose from .
" The Press " looked at which the corporation could defend itself and which could really hurt it .

In urban nurseries , the clock is turned back .
On 1 September , the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal daycare centres ( Kitas ) again on its own .
For Sonja Pommeranz , deputy head of the Youth Aid department , this is good news : " we were all very pleased . "
Cooking continues outside the house : a caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled food .
In the Krefeld region , the city runs 46 day-care centres , while in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime .
In the past year of kitesurfing , 2800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
" In the meantime , it 's not just children who are cared for 45 hours a week who eat lunch at the Kita , " explains Pommeranz .
" The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm . "
From 1 September , 46 part-time workers will be in charge of the kitchen : they will warm up the food supplied , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , individually portioning the meal , handing out the food , clearing it , rinsing and cleaning the kitchen .
" The employees are permanently assigned to a nursery , " says Pommeranz .
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the number of hours .
" The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the kitesurfing team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .
" So they are much more involved and it is easier for the management to implement pedagogical concepts . "
Because that 's also what it 's all about : healthy eating and cooking classes .
" The children should help prepare the food . "
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team makes sense .
For the children , too .
" They have a known force in the Kita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . "
This continuity is important for the children .
The cleaning of the kita-rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff .
This option - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen service , the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between owning and contracting out for the city , according to the Press Office .
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited .
" But with around 750 people in the field of education , these hours do not weigh as much , " says Sonja Pommeranz .
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Haysom , acting head of the United Nations mission , said hundreds of women will stand in provincial council elections , with three women running for vice-president roles and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women .
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said in a statement on Wednesday .
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5 .
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role .
This year , for the first time , the elections will hand over power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next .
Haysom said a strong role for women will add to Afghanistan 's democratic success .
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men , aged 19 and 23 , allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .
According to police information , the men approached the 13-year-old , who was on Kolping Street with friends , at around 2.55pm because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl 's mobile phone .
However , the 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends .
As a result , one of the offenders tried to grab the girl 's cell phone and necklace , but this failed .
Without loot , the duo fled .
The two young men were later arrested by the police .
The investigation is ongoing .
GMB concerns over investment in Glasgow 's McVitie factory
A union wants to reassure managers at Biscuit maker McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant .
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products .
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than £ 5m in recent years .
He added that staff and union representatives would be " the first to know " if their activities changed .
In a letter to the company 's branch manager , GMB Scotland urged McVitie 's to " raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being driven forward . "
MBM senior organiser Drew Duffy said : " the fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , pay and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie . "
A Pladis spokeswoman said : " the branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued commitment among staff and union representatives .
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .
We discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive .
She added : " in recent years we have invested more than £ 5 million in our Tollcross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .
We fully recognise Tollcross ' heritage as a manufacturing site . Should our operations at the site change , employees and their union representatives will be the first to know . "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago ?
La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar , having made an offer of £ 189m to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona of the world record raid three years ago ?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer as the Ligue 1 club are poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £ 89 million last season .
Once finished , Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional sportsman in the world , with PSG offering wages of more than £ 500,000 a week .
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out , although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club have always done their best to look after him since arriving from Santos in 2013 .
But was the football world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago ?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted one of PSG 's best players to sign .
" I 'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " Al-Khelaifi said .
" We respect all the clubs .
But if they try to have one of our players sign with them , it will have consequences . "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer .
PSG made it clear they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their prize bids for Neymar .
Scooters overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown offender deliberately flipped a scooter parked in Königsfelder Strasse in front of the number 30 estate , causing property damage of more than 200 euros to the vehicle 's cladding .
Police Schramberg , phone + 49 ( 0 ) 7422 / 27 01-0 , asks for information .
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese .
Because a car met him in his lane , the driver of a VW Touran had to evade , touching the control panel .
On Thursday evening , the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling in the direction of Leese with his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau at 7.55 p.m.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau , a car came towards him in his lane , so he had to turn to the right .
At the same time , the Touran driver touched the control panel .
Damage to property was caused to the car .
The driver of the oncoming car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the road accident .
According to the accident victim , it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident .
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the vehicle to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau on + 49 ( 0 ) 5761 / 92060 .
Interview : " Domspatzen Report relieves Papal Brother Georg Ratzinger "
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves the burden of the papal brother Georg Ratzinger .
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann .
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to spark debate .
Christian Weisnder , spokesman for the reform movement " we are Church , " said after the publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI .
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at the time .
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano , " on the other hand , criticized the " double standards " in the reporting of violence among the cathedral patrons .
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are " shameful and shameful acts " that must be punished and prevented in the future , but the " degree of media manipulation " is striking , said author Lucetta Scaraffia , a historian and member of the Italian national bioethics committee .
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " writes Scaraffia .
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also commented in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : " people like to go to church and that 's a feast . "
She also pointed out that , in her youth , " beatings were a normal pedagogical means " of coping with naughty children , like I was one . "
It would find it unfair to apply today 's standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed .
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases , the Pope 's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .
Author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the book " my Brother the Pope " with Ratzinger ( translated into 12 languages ) , is completely wrong .
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he assesses the results of the final report .
What exactly does the 440-page report by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the investigation , contain ?
A total of 547 Regensburg Cathedral patrons were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s " with high plausibility " by victims of assaults , 67 Cathedral patrons .
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " to sum up , then , it can be said that in many cases , Cathedral Kapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence .
Particularly with a high degree of emotionality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .
Nevertheless , unlike many other accused , it is noticeable that many victims appreciated R. " s general humanity and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even have positive memories with him . "
In an interview , Hesemann explains why , in his opinion , the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger .
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the " incidents of violence against defendants at the Regensburger Domspatzen " gives a contradictory picture of cathedral master Georg Ratzinger .
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity . "
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist , who often became tangible when a cathedral piece failed to produce a top performance .
As his biographer , how do you rate this final report ?
Michael Hesemann : if you take the trouble to read the entire 440 page report from front to back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually appears in it .
Only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
The violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
At best , he can be accused of learning of it too late or of not taking the initial indications seriously enough .
The Domspatzengymnasium , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - " redemption , " " heaven " and " better world . "
So the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also gives an excellent testimony , describing him as " warm-hearted , " " popular , " " sincere , " " competent , " and " understanding , " an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and was " always surrounded by grapes from children . "
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which sometimes led to outbursts of rage .
Years ago , he himself admitted , deeply regretted and apologised for the fact that he not only cracked chairs and threw the key ring to the floor , but also distributed slaps and pulled all too cheeky boys by the hair or ears .
In order to save his honour , however , it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , both among parents and teachers .
Do you know such methods of punishment ?
Of course , I think every one of us born before 1968 .
I , too , experienced it in a secular school , a state high school .
Compared to what this report is really about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence at preschool , these are , of course , petty .
One wonders whether it is not his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many of the media rushed to him .
Many people who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian Pope .
But the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen .
Will Georg Ratzinger also be accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hesemann : clearly , no .
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral chaplain .
Not even the parents were consecrated .
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said one of the victims , speaking on behalf of the others , " I was very embarrassed . "
The real problem with the investigation of sexual abuse was , and still is , that most victims remain silent out of shame .
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , then certainly not to a choir director , who in a certain way would have been a colleague of the offenders .
How do the pupils of Domspatzen assess Ratzinger 's role in relation to the cases of abuse ?
Michael Hesemann : as one student interviewed put it : " with regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... Any case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) of all people would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .
I think it is ... Also really absurd to assume that he of all people ... Boys have opened up more forcefully , or more clearly , than to their parents , boarding school leaders , confidence teachers , etc .
That you talk to him about sex ... Unthinkable . "
Thus , the report comes to the very clear conclusion : " it was not possible to confirm that pupils and / or their surroundings had entrusted themselves to him beforehand . "
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempt from any form of complicity .
In this way , he cannot be accused of failing to prevent or bring him to trial .
Therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes , as unfortunately has happened in some cases .
There was a lot of talk in the media about " violent excesses " at the Regensburger Domspatzen .
Former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused of " looking the other way " in the report .
Does he have to live with this accusation ?
Michael Hesemann : that 's the big problem , that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .
There is a clean separation : between the preschool and the high school of cathedral patrons , between sexual abuse and violent excesses , as well as , shall we say , other accusations .
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the cathedral patrons .
All the terrible pedagogy of beatings , the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly , all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed .
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium .
On that , as most witnesses point out , the topic of " preschool " was taboo .
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed so much better treatment and , for many , even " paradisiacal " conditions .
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium ?
Michael Hesemann : there was discipline , but no sadistic violence .
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger , for whom the report concludes that " many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence , even associate positive memories with him . "
The only thing left is the accusation of having looked the other way .
But despite all the efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was told of preschool conditions .
The first time was in 1970 / 71 , when he was just starting to establish himself and didn 't want to hear about what was going on at a school where he just wasn 't acting and was responsible ( according to the witness ) , and then again around 1993 .
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions ?
Michael Hesemann : no , because back in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .
In it , he points out that " caning continues to be practised in the preschool . "
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity , when caning was long prohibited in Bavaria .
Before that , they were in a legal grey area , as we all know .
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected may have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded .
Nor can we say that he has always looked the other way .
That is simply not true .
It was only in 1980 that caning was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's pedagogical standards to the time .
How do you see it ?
Michael Hesemann : we historians are talking about the " pitfall of anachronism , " that is , the danger of assessing the past according to today 's moral standards .
The princess is right .
But , of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was breached in preschool in terms of viciousness and violence against innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond what was common at the time .
It 's all very horrible and I 'm glad it 's finally being worked up .
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is , slapping and pulling hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
When corporal punishment was then banned , he also adhered strictly to it .
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in his conversations with you for the book " my Brother the Pope " ?
Did the subject of caning also come up ?
Michael Hesemann : well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective that the cathedral patrons played only a minor role .
Nevertheless , I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there .
But this too must be said : without this perfectionism , without demanding absolute discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to transform the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen into a world-class institution , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
With biscuits and sweets alone , you do not turn rebellious boys into great singers and you stand in front of every success , no matter in which field , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book ?
Michael Hesemann : through the work on the book and beyond , I got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful , humorous , gracious , deeply believing and hearty person , of whom it is impossible to imagine that he could do anything to a fly .
I regularly hear how many former cathedral patrons still today , 23 years after his retirement , keep regular contact with him , visit him , read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
So those who still do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority .
Most cathedral patrons today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and teaching them the world of music .
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a kind person of respect , whom they still look up to today and whom they almost worship .
And please , let us be clear : all he is accused of are methods of education , which were the order of the day at the time .
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
But it is most unfair to make a man a media scapegoat simply because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious .
Because the report that has just been published relieves him .
Now , the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man , who has earned great merits and without whom , outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany , no one would know the Regensburg cathedral patrons , would finally leave in peace .
